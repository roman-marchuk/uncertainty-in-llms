Alice and Bob play the following game. On Alice's turn, she must replace some integer $n$ on the board with $n+a$, and on Bob's turn he must replace some even integer $n$ on the board with $n\/2$. Alice goes first and they alternate turns. If on his turn Bob has no valid moves, the game ends.\n\nAfter analyzing the integers on the board, Bob realizes that, regardless of what moves Alice makes, he will be able to force the game to end eventually. Show that, in fact, for this value of $a$ and these integers on the board, the game is guaranteed to end regardless of Alice's or Bob's moves.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nThe contrapositive of the claim is somewhat easier to conceptualize: If it is not guaranteed that the game will end (i.e. the game could potentially last forever), then Bob is not able to force the game to end (i.e. Alice can force it to last forever). So we want to prove that, if the game can potentially last indefinitely, then Alice can force it to last indefinitely. Clearly, if there is $1$ number on the board initially, all moves are forced. This means the claim is true in this specific case, because if the game \"potentially\" can last forever, this means it must last forever, since the game can only be played in one way. Ergo Alice can \"force\" this to occur because it is guaranteed to occur. Now we look at all cases where there is more than $1$ number on the board.\n-The contrapositive of the claim is somewhat easier to conceptualize: If it is not guaranteed that the game will end (i.e. the game could potentially last forever), then Bob is not able to force the game to end (i.e. Alice can force it to last forever).

Ergo Alice can \"force\" this to occur because it is guaranteed to occur. Now we look at all cases where there is more than $1$ number on the board.\n\n\nCase 1: $v_2 (a)=0$ The game lasts forever here no matter what. This is true because, if the game ends, it means the board was in some position $P$ , Alice added $a$ to some number on the board, and all the numbers now on the board are odd. If there are only odd numbers on the board in position $P$ , Alice will add $a$ to some number on the board, making it even, meaning this cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. If at least one number n on the board is even, Alice can add $a$ to a number other than $n$ , meaning there is still at least 1 even number on the board, meaning this also cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. This covers all possible boards when $v_2 (a)=0$ , so we're done.\n\n\nCase 2: $v_2 (a)=1$ If there is at least one number n on the board that is even, the game can also last forever. On any move, Alice will add $a$ to this number $n$ if and only if $v_2 (n)=1$ . This way, the new number $n'= n+a$ satisfies $v_2 (n') \\geq 2$ . If Bob does divides $n'$ until $v_2 (n)=1$ , Alice will again add $a$ to $n$ resulting in $v_2 (n') \\geq 2$ . This means that Alice can always keep an even number on the board for Bob to divide no matter how Bob plays.\n\nIf there is no even number on the board, then the game can clearly not last forever. No matter what Alice does, Bob will have no even number to divide after her move.\n\n\nGeneral Case: $v_2 (a)=x$ In general, it seems to be the case that the game can last indefinitely for some given $a$ if and only if there exists some number $n$ on the board such that $v_2 (n) \\geq v_2 (a)$ , so we should aim to prove this.\n\n1. \"If\"\n\nAlice can apply a similar strategy to the strategy used in case 2. On any move, Alice will add $a$ to $n$ if and only if $v_2 (n)=v_2 (a)$ . If she does this addition, then $v_2 (n') \\geq v_2 (a)+1$ , keeping an even number on the board. Even if Bob divides $n'$ until $v_2 (n)=v_2 (a)$ , Alice will apply the same strategy and keep <missing 1> . Alice's use of this strategy ensures that there always exists some number n on the board such that $v_2 (n) \\geq v_2 (a)$ , ensuring there always exists an even number n on the board.\n\n2.\"Only If\"\n\nIf $v_2 (n) < v_2 (a)$ for all n on the board, this means that Alice can never change the value of <missing 2> for any $n$ on the board. Only Bob can do this, and Bob will subtract $1$ from each $v_2 (n)$ until they are all equal to $0$ (all odd), ending the game.\n\nWe've shown that the game can last indefinitely iff there exists some number $n$ on the board such that $v_2 (n) \\geq v_2 (a)$ , and have shown that Alice can ensure the game lasts forever in these scenarios using the above strategy. This proves the contrapositive, proving the claim.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> v_2 (n) \n<expression 2> v_2 (n') \\geq v_2 (a)+1 \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"],"ground_truth":"2,1"}

We say that a collection $C$ of identical dominoes is a maximal grid-aligned configuration on the board if $C$ consists of $(n^2-1)\/2$ dominoes where each domino covers exactly two neighboring squares and the dominoes don't overlap: $C$ then covers all but one square on the board. We are allowed to slide (but not rotate) a domino on the board to cover the uncovered square, resulting in a new maximal grid-aligned configuration with another square uncovered. Let $k(C)$ be the number of distinct maximal grid-aligned configurations obtainable from $C$ by repeatedly sliding dominoes. Find the maximum value of $k(C)$ as a function of $n$.\n-Consider an $n$-by-$n$ board of unit squares for some odd positive integer $n$.

We are allowed to slide (but not rotate) a domino on the board to cover the uncovered square, resulting in a new maximal grid-aligned configuration with another square uncovered. Let $k(C)$ be the number of distinct maximal grid-aligned configurations obtainable from $C$ by repeatedly sliding dominoes. Find the maximum value of $k(C)$ as a function of $n$.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nWe claim the answer is <missing 1> .\n-We claim the answer is <missing 2> .\n\nFirst, consider a checkerboard tiling of the board with 4 colors: R, G, B, Y. Number each column from $1$ to $n$ from left to right and each row from $1$ to $n$ from top to bottom. We color a tile R if its row and column are odd, a tile G is its row is even but its column is odd, a tile B if its row and column is even, and a tile Y if its row is odd but its column is even.\n\nLemma 1: Throughout our moves, the color of the uncolored tile stays an invariant.\n\nConsider that a domino can either only change rows or can only change columns. Therefore, sliding a domino into the hole and creating a new one has two possible colors. Of these, note that the new hole will always trivially be two tiles away from the old hole, meaning that the parity of both the row and column number stays the same. Thus, the lemma holds.\n\nLemma 2: There are more red tiles than any other color. Because each color is uniquely defined by the parity of a pair of column and row number, it satisfies to show that given an odd integer $n$ , there are more odd positive integers less than or equal to $n$ than even ones. Obviously, this is true, and so red will have more tiles than any other color.\n\nLemma 3: For any starting configuration $C$ and any blank tile $B$ such that the blank tile's color matches the blank tile's color of $C$ , there is no more than one unique configuration $C'$ that can be produced from $C$ using valid moves.\n\nWe will use proof by contradiction. Assume there exists two different $C'$ . We can get from one of these $C'$ to another using moves. However, we have to finish off with the same hole as before. Before the last move, the hole must be two tiles away from the starting hole. However, because the domino we used to move into the blank tile's spot is in the way, that hole must be congruent to the hole produced after the first move. We can induct this logic, and because there is a limited amount of tiles with the same color, eventually we will run out of tiles to apply this to. Therefore, having two distinct <missing 3> with the same starting hole $B$ is impossible with some $C$ .\n\nWe will now prove that <missing 4> is the answer. There are $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ rows and $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ columns that are odd, and thus there are <missing 5> red tiles. Given lemma 3, this is our upper bound for a maximum. To establish that $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ is indeed possible, we construct such a $C$ :\n\nIn the first column, leave the first tile up blank. Then, continuously fill in vertically oriented dominos in that column until it reaches the bottom. In the next <missing 6> columns, place $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ vertically oriented dominos in a row starting from the top. At the bottom row, starting with the first unfilled tile on the left, place horizontally aligned dominos in a row until you reach the right.\n\nObviously, the top left tile is red. It suffices to show that any red tile may be uncovered. For the first column, one may slide some dominos on the first column until the desired tile is uncovered. For the bottom row, all the first dominos may be slid up, and then the bottom dominos may be slid to the left until the desired red tile is uncovered. Finally, for the rest of the red tiles, the bottom red tile in the same color may be revealed, and then vertically aligned dominos in the same column may be slid down until the desired tile is revealed. Therefore, this configuration may produce $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ different configurations with moves.\n\nHence, we have proved that <missing 7> is the maximum, and we are done.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> C' \n<expression 2> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 3> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 4> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 5> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 6> (\\frac{n+1}{2})^2 \n<expression 7> n-1 \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"],"ground_truth":"3,5,1,2,4,7,6"}

For example, if your answer starts as 5, 22, 3, ..., then that means expression 5 fills <missing 1>, expression 22 fills <missing 2>, and expression 3 fills <missing 3>.  \n\nThe question is:\nFor each integer $k \\geqslant 2$, determine all infinite sequences of positive integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots$ for which there exists a polynomial $P$ of the form $P(x)=x^k+c_{k-1} x^{k-1}+\\cdots+c_1 x+c_0$, where $c_0, c_1, \\ldots, c_{k-1}$ are non-negative integers, such that\\[P\\left(a_n\\right)=a_{n+1} a_{n+2} \\cdots a_{n+k}\\]for every integer $n \\geqslant 1$.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nLet <missing 1> and <missing 2> be functions of positive integers $n$ and $j$ respectively.\n\nLet $a_{n}=a_{1}+f(n)$ , then <missing 3> , and $a_{n+k}=a_{1}+f(n+k)$ Let $P=\\prod_{j=1}^{k}\\left ( a_{n+j} \\right ) = \\prod_{j=1}^{k}\\left ( a_{n}+g(j)) \\right )$ If we want the coefficients of $P(a_{n})$ to be positive, then $g(j)\\geq 0$ for all $j$ which will give the following value for $P$ : $P=a_{n}^{k}+C_{k-1}a_{n}^{k-1}+...+C_{1}a_{n}+\\prod_{j=1}^{k} g(j) = P(a_{n})$ Thus for every $j$ and $n$ we need the following: $a_{n}+g(j)=a_{n+j}=a_{1}+f(n+j)$ Solving for $g(j)$ we get: $g(j)=a_{1}+f(n+j)-a_{n}=a_{1}+f(n+j)-a_{1}-f(n)$  $g(j)=f(n+j)-f(n)\\geq 0$ for all $n$ and $j$ because $g(j)$ needs to be greater than or equal to zero for all coefficients to be non-negative.\n\nThis means that $f(n)$ needs to be increasing with $n$ , or staying constant, and also with $f(1)=0$ because $a_{1}=a_{1}+f(1)$ .\n\nIn addition, since we need all coefficients to be integer, then all $f(n)$ and $g(j)$ must also be integers. We also need $g(j)$ to not be dependent of $n$ , so in the expression $f(n+j)-f(n)$ , the $n$ needs to cancel. This mean that the rate of change for $f(n)$ with respect to $n$ needs to be constant. This can only be achieved with $f(n)$ be the equation of a line with slope being either zero or positive integer.\n\nSo, we set $f(n)$ to be the equation of a line as $f(n)=mn+b$ with $m$ being the slope with a non-negative value and with $b$ the intercept at $n=0$ . We know that $f(1)=0$ so $f(1)=m+b=0$ which means that $b=-m$ and our function becomes $f(n)=mn-m=(n-1)m$ . Since $f(n)$ needs to be non-negative integer then $m\\geq 0 \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ then $f(n)$ is increasing or constant, with $f(1)=0$ Then, $g(j)=f(n+j)-f(n)=(n+j-1)m-(n-1)m=jm$ This gives: $\\prod_{j=1}^{k}\\left ( a_{n}+jm \\right )=P(a_{n})=a_{n}^{k}+C_{k-1}a_{n}^{k-1}+...+C_{1}a_{n}+k!m^{k}$ with $C_{0}=k!m^{k}$ and coefficients of polynomial <missing 4> Then, $a_{n}=a_{1}+f(n)$ Which provides the solution of all infinite sequences of positive integers as: $a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1)m$ , $\\forall m\\geq 0 \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $a_{1} \\geq 1 \\mid a_{1} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ \n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> f(n) \n<expression 2> \\geq 0 \n<expression 3> g(j) \n<expression 4> a_{n+1}=a_{1}+f(n+1) \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"],"ground_truth":"1,3,4,2"}

For each non-empty $T \\subseteq \\{S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_{100}\\}$, the size of the intersection of the sets in $T$ is a multiple of $|T|$. What is the smallest possible number of elements which are in at least 50 sets?\n\nThe solution is:\nThe answer is <missing 1> .  We encode with binary strings <missing 2> of length 100. Write <missing 3> if $w$ has 1's in every component $v$ does, and let $|v|$ denote the number of 1's in $v$ . Then for each $v$ , we let $f(v)$ denote the number of elements <missing 4> such that <missing 5> . So the problem condition means that $f(v)$ translates to the statement <missing 6> for any <missing 7> , plus one extra condition <missing 8> . And the objective function is to minimize the quantity <missing 9> . So the problem is transformed into a system of equations over <missing 10> . Note already that it suffices to assign $f(v)$ for $|v| \\geq 50$ , then we can always arbitrarily assign values of $f(v)$ for $|v| < 50$ by downwards induction on $|v|$ to satisfy the divisibility condition (without changing $M$ ). Thus for the rest of the solution, we altogether ignore $f(v)$ for $|v| < 50$ and only consider $P(u)$ for <missing 11> . Now consider the construction: <missing 12> This construction is valid since if <missing 13> for <missing 14> then <missing 15>  <missing 16> is indeed a multiple of <missing 17> , hence $P(u)$ is true. In that case, the objective function is <missing 18> as needed.\n\n\u00b6 Proof of bound. We are going to use a smoothing argument: if we have a general working assignment $f$ , we will mold it into <missing 19> . We define a push-down on $v$ as the following operation: Pick any $v$ such that $|v| \\geq 50$ and <missing 20> .  Decrease $f(v)$ by $|v|$ .  For every $w$ such that <missing 21> and <missing 22> , increase <missing 23> by 1.  Claim \u2014 Apply a push-down preserves the main divisibility condition. Moreover, it doesn't change $A$ unless $|v| = 50$ , where it decreases $A$ by 50 instead.  Proof. The statement $P(u)$ is only affected when <missing 24> : to be precise, one term on the right-hand side of $P(u)$ decreases by $|v|$ , while <missing 25> terms increase by 1, for a net change of <missing 26> . So $P(u)$ still holds.  To see $A$ doesn't change for <missing 27> , note $|v|$ terms increase by 1 while one term decreases by <missing 28> . When $|v| = 50$ , only $f(v)$ decreases by 50.\u25a1\nNow, given a valid assignment, we can modify it as follows: First apply pushdowns on <missing 29> until $f(1\\ldots1) = 100$ ; Then we may apply pushdowns on each $v$ with <missing 30> until <missing 31> ; Then we may apply pushdowns on each $v$ with <missing 32> until <missing 33> ; ...and so on, until we have <missing 34> for $|v| = 50$ .  Hence we get $f(1\\ldots1) = 100$ and <missing 35> for all <missing 36> . However, by downwards induction on <missing 37> , we also have <missing 38> since <missing 39> and $f(v)$ are both strictly less than $|v|$ . So in fact <missing 40> , and we're done.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> f = f_0 \n<expression 2> P(u): |u| \\texttt{ divides } \\sum_{v \\supseteq u} f(v) \n<expression 3> |w| = |v| - 1 \n<expression 4> f_0 \n<expression 5> x\\in S_i \\iff v_i = 1 \n<expression 6> v \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^{100} \n<expression 7> f_0(v) = 2|v| - 100. \n<expression 8> = (100 - k) \\cdot 2^k = |u| \\cdot 2^k \n<expression 9> v \\subseteq w \n<expression 10> u \\neq 0, \\dots 0 \n<expression 11> 50 \\leq |v| \\leq 100 \n<expression 12> 1\\ldots1 \n<expression 13> f_0(v) \n<expression 14> |v| = 99, 98, \\ldots, 50 \n<expression 15> |v| - |u| \n<expression 16> u \\subseteq v \n<expression 17> A = \\sum_{i=50}^{100} \\binom{100}{i}(2i - 100) = 50\\binom{100}{50} \n<expression 18> f(w) \n<expression 19> |v| > 50 \n<expression 20> -|v| \n<expression 21> \\sum_{v \\supseteq u} f_0(v) = \\binom{k}{0} \\cdot 100 + \\binom{k}{1} \\cdot 98 + \\binom{k}{2} \\cdot 96 + \\cdots + \\binom{k}{k} \\cdot (100 - 2k) \n<expression 22> f(v) < 99 \n<expression 23> A := \\sum_{|v| \\geq 50} f(v) \n<expression 24> |u| \\geq 50 \n<expression 25> w \\subseteq v \n<expression 26> f(v) < 98 \n<expression 27> 50\\binom{100}{50} \n<expression 28> f(1\\dots 1) > 0 \n<expression 29> f(v) \\equiv f_0(v) \\pmod{|v|} \\implies f(v) = f_0(v) \n<expression 30> x\\in \\bigcup S_i \n<expression 31> |v| = 99 \n<expression 32> 0 \\leq f(v) < |v| \n<expression 33> |u| = 100 - k \n<expression 34> k \\leq 50 \n<expression 35> |u| \n<expression 36> |v| = 98 \n<expression 37> f(v) \\geq |v| \n<expression 38> mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0} \n<expression 39> f(v) < 50 \n<expression 40> -|u| \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"],"ground_truth":"27,6,9,30,5,2,10,28,23,38,24,7,33,34,21,8,35,17,4,37,25,3,18,16,15,40,19,20,12,31,22,36,26,39,32,11,14,29,13,1"}

We say that a collection $C$ of identical dominoes is a maximal grid-aligned configuration on the board if $C$ consists of $(n^2-1)\/2$ dominoes where each domino covers exactly two neighboring squares and the dominoes don't overlap: $C$ then covers all but one square on the board. We are allowed to slide (but not rotate) a domino on the board to cover the uncovered square, resulting in a new maximal grid-aligned configuration with another square uncovered. Let $k(C)$ be the number of distinct maximal grid-aligned configurations obtainable from $C$ by repeatedly sliding dominoes. Find the maximum value of $k(C)$ as a function of $n$.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nWe claim the answer is $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ .\n\nFirst, consider a checkerboard tiling of the board with 4 colors: R, G, B, Y. Number each column from $1$ to $n$ from left to right and each row from $1$ to $n$ from top to bottom. We color a tile R if its row and column are odd, a tile G is its row is even but its column is odd, a tile B if its row and column is even, and a tile Y if its row is odd but its column is even.\n\nLemma 1: Throughout our moves, the color of the uncolored tile stays an invariant.\n\nConsider that a domino can either only change rows or can only change columns. Therefore, sliding a domino into the hole and creating a new one has two possible colors. Of these, note that the new hole will always trivially be two tiles away from the old hole, meaning that the parity of both the row and column number stays the same. Thus, the lemma holds.\n\nLemma 2: There are more red tiles than any other color. Because each color is uniquely defined by the parity of a pair of column and row number, it satisfies to show that given an odd integer $n$ , there are more odd positive integers less than or equal to $n$ than even ones. Obviously, this is true, and so red will have more tiles than any other color.\n\nLemma 3: For any starting configuration $C$ and any blank tile $B$ such that the blank tile's color matches the blank tile's color of $C$ , there is no more than one unique configuration $C'$ that can be produced from $C$ using valid moves.\n\nWe will use proof by contradiction. Assume there exists two different $C'$ . We can get from one of these $C'$ to another using moves. However, we have to finish off with the same hole as before. Before the last move, the hole must be two tiles away from the starting hole. However, because the domino we used to move into the blank tile's spot is in the way, that hole must be congruent to the hole produced after the first move. We can induct this logic, and because there is a limited amount of tiles with the same color, eventually we will run out of tiles to apply this to. Therefore, having two distinct $C'$ with the same starting hole $B$ is impossible with some $C$ .\n\nWe will now prove that $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ is the answer. There are $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ rows and $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ columns that are odd, and thus there are $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ red tiles. Given lemma 3, this is our upper bound for a maximum. To establish that $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ is indeed possible, we construct such a $C$ :\n\nIn the first column, leave the first tile up blank. Then, continuously fill in vertically oriented dominos in that column until it reaches the bottom. In the next <missing 1> columns, place <missing 2> vertically oriented dominos in a row starting from the top. At the bottom row, starting with the first unfilled tile on the left, place horizontally aligned dominos in a row until you reach the right.\n\nObviously, the top left tile is red. It suffices to show that any red tile may be uncovered. For the first column, one may slide some dominos on the first column until the desired tile is uncovered. For the bottom row, all the first dominos may be slid up, and then the bottom dominos may be slid to the left until the desired red tile is uncovered.

Alice goes first and they alternate turns. If on his turn Bob has no valid moves, the game ends.\n\nAfter analyzing the integers on the board, Bob realizes that, regardless of what moves Alice makes, he will be able to force the game to end eventually. Show that, in fact, for this value of $a$ and these integers on the board, the game is guaranteed to end regardless of Alice's or Bob's moves.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nThe contrapositive of the claim is somewhat easier to conceptualize: If it is not guaranteed that the game will end (i.e. the game could potentially last forever), then Bob is not able to force the game to end (i.e. Alice can force it to last forever). So we want to prove that, if the game can potentially last indefinitely, then Alice can force it to last indefinitely. Clearly, if there is $1$ number on the board initially, all moves are forced. This means the claim is true in this specific case, because if the game \"potentially\" can last forever, this means it must last forever, since the game can only be played in one way. Ergo Alice can \"force\" this to occur because it is guaranteed to occur. Now we look at all cases where there is more than $1$ number on the board.\n-The contrapositive of the claim is somewhat easier to conceptualize: If it is not guaranteed that the game will end (i.e. the game could potentially last forever), then Bob is not able to force the game to end (i.e. Alice can force it to last forever).

Now we look at all cases where there is more than $1$ number on the board.\n\n\nCase 1: <missing 1> The game lasts forever here no matter what. This is true because, if the game ends, it means the board was in some position $P$ , Alice added $a$ to some number on the board, and all the numbers now on the board are odd. If there are only odd numbers on the board in position $P$ , Alice will add $a$ to some number on the board, making it even, meaning this cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. If at least one number n on the board is even, Alice can add $a$ to a number other than $n$ , meaning there is still at least 1 even number on the board, meaning this also cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. This covers all possible boards when <missing 2> , so we're done.\n\n\nCase 2: <missing 3> If there is at least one number n on the board that is even, the game can also last forever. On any move, Alice will add $a$ to this number $n$ if and only if $v_2 (n)=1$ . This way, the new number $n'= n+a$ satisfies <missing 4> . If Bob does divides $n'$ until <missing 5> , Alice will again add $a$ to $n$ resulting in <missing 6> .

For each non-empty $T \\subseteq \\{S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_{100}\\}$, the size of the intersection of the sets in $T$ is a multiple of $|T|$. What is the smallest possible number of elements which are in at least 50 sets?\n\nThe solution is:\nThe answer is <missing 1> .  We encode with binary strings <missing 2> of length 100. Write <missing 3> if $w$ has 1's in every component $v$ does, and let $|v|$ denote the number of 1's in $v$ . Then for each $v$ , we let $f(v)$ denote the number of elements <missing 4> such that <missing 5> . So the problem condition means that $f(v)$ translates to the statement <missing 6> for any <missing 7> , plus one extra condition <missing 8> . And the objective function is to minimize the quantity <missing 9> . So the problem is transformed into a system of equations over <missing 10> . Note already that it suffices to assign $f(v)$ for $|v| \\geq 50$ , then we can always arbitrarily assign values of $f(v)$ for $|v| < 50$ by downwards induction on $|v|$ to satisfy the divisibility condition (without changing $M$ ). Thus for the rest of the solution, we altogether ignore $f(v)$ for $|v| < 50$ and only consider $P(u)$ for <missing 11> . Now consider the construction: <missing 12> This construction is valid since if <missing 13> for <missing 14> then <missing 15>  <missing 16> is indeed a multiple of <missing 17> , hence $P(u)$ is true. In that case, the objective function is <missing 18> as needed.\n\n\u00b6 Proof of bound. We are going to use a smoothing argument: if we have a general working assignment $f$ , we will mold it into <missing 19> . We define a push-down on $v$ as the following operation: Pick any $v$ such that $|v| \\geq 50$ and <missing 20> .  Decrease $f(v)$ by $|v|$ .  For every $w$ such that <missing 21> and <missing 22> , increase <missing 23> by 1.  Claim \u2014 Apply a push-down preserves the main divisibility condition. Moreover, it doesn't change $A$ unless $|v| = 50$ , where it decreases $A$ by 50 instead.  Proof. The statement $P(u)$ is only affected when <missing 24> : to be precise, one term on the right-hand side of $P(u)$ decreases by $|v|$ , while <missing 25> terms increase by 1, for a net change of <missing 26> . So $P(u)$ still holds.  To see $A$ doesn't change for <missing 27> , note $|v|$ terms increase by 1 while one term decreases by <missing 28> . When $|v| = 50$ , only $f(v)$ decreases by 50.\u25a1\nNow, given a valid assignment, we can modify it as follows: First apply pushdowns on <missing 29> until $f(1\\ldots1) = 100$ ; Then we may apply pushdowns on each $v$ with <missing 30> until <missing 31> ; Then we may apply pushdowns on each $v$ with <missing 32> until <missing 33> ; ...and so on, until we have <missing 34> for $|v| = 50$ .  Hence we get $f(1\\ldots1) = 100$ and <missing 35> for all <missing 36> . However, by downwards induction on <missing 37> , we also have <missing 38> since <missing 39> and $f(v)$ are both strictly less than $|v|$ . So in fact <missing 40> , and we're done.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> 0 \\leq f(v) < |v| \n<expression 2> f_0(v) \n<expression 3> -|u| \n<expression 4> x\\in \\bigcup S_i \n<expression 5> u \\neq 0, \\dots 0 \n<expression 6> k \\leq 50 \n<expression 7> A := \\sum_{|v| \\geq 50} f(v) \n<expression 8> P(u): |u| \\texttt{ divides } \\sum_{v \\supseteq u} f(v) \n<expression 9> 1\\ldots1 \n<expression 10> mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0} \n<expression 11> |w| = |v| - 1 \n<expression 12> |u| \n<expression 13> f_0(v) = 2|v| - 100. \n<expression 14> |v| = 98 \n<expression 15> -|v| \n<expression 16> \\sum_{v \\supseteq u} f_0(v) = \\binom{k}{0} \\cdot 100 + \\binom{k}{1} \\cdot 98 + \\binom{k}{2} \\cdot 96 + \\cdots + \\binom{k}{k} \\cdot (100 - 2k) \n<expression 17> |v| > 50 \n<expression 18> A = \\sum_{i=50}^{100} \\binom{100}{i}(2i - 100) = 50\\binom{100}{50} \n<expression 19> |v| = 99, 98, \\ldots, 50 \n<expression 20> f(v) \\equiv f_0(v) \\pmod{|v|} \\implies f(v) = f_0(v) \n<expression 21> x\\in S_i \\iff v_i = 1 \n<expression 22> 50 \\leq |v| \\leq 100 \n<expression 23> v \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^{100} \n<expression 24> u \\subseteq v \n<expression 25> f(v) < 98 \n<expression 26> f_0 \n<expression 27> |v| = 99 \n<expression 28> f(v) \\geq |v| \n<expression 29> f(1\\dots 1) > 0 \n<expression 30> v \\subseteq w \n<expression 31> f = f_0 \n<expression 32> f(v) < 99 \n<expression 33> |v| - |u| \n<expression 34> w \\subseteq v \n<expression 35> |u| = 100 - k \n<expression 36> f(v) < 50 \n<expression 37> = (100 - k) \\cdot 2^k = |u| \\cdot 2^k \n<expression 38> f(w) \n<expression 39> 50\\binom{100}{50} \n<expression 40> |u| \\geq 50 \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"],"ground_truth":"39,23,30,4,21,8,5,29,7,10,40,13,35,6,16,37,12,18,26,28,34,11,38,24,33,3,17,15,9,27,32,14,25,36,1,22,19,20,2,31"}

Determine, with proof, all possible values of the ordered pair $(m, n)$\n\nThe solution is:\nThe answer is <missing 1> only.  Proof the task requires $m \\le n+1$ . Each of the $m$ blocks has a red bead count between $0$ and $n$ , each of which appears at most once, so $m \\le n+1$ is needed.  Construction when <missing 2> . For concreteness, here is the construction for <missing 3> , which obviously generalizes. The beads are listed in reading order as an array with <missing 4> rows and $n$ columns. Four of the blue beads have been labeled <missing 5> , \\dots, <missing 6> to make them easier to track as they move. <missing 7> To prove this construction works, it suffices to consider the $n$ cuts <missing 8> , <missing 9> , <missing 10> , \\dots, <missing 11> made where $T_i$ differs from <missing 12> by having the cuts one bead later also have the property each row has a distinct red count: <missing 13> We can construct a table showing for each <missing 14> the number of red beads which are in the <missing 15> st row of $T_i$ from the bottom: <missing 16> This suggests following explicit formula for the entry of the <missing 17> th cell which can then be checked straightforwardly: <missing 18> And one can see for each $i$ , the counts are all distinct (they are <missing 19> from bottom to top).

We are allowed to slide (but not rotate) a domino on the board to cover the uncovered square, resulting in a new maximal grid-aligned configuration with another square uncovered. Let $k(C)$ be the number of distinct maximal grid-aligned configurations obtainable from $C$ by repeatedly sliding dominoes. Find the maximum value of $k(C)$ as a function of $n$.\n-Consider an $n$-by-$n$ board of unit squares for some odd positive integer $n$.

We are allowed to slide (but not rotate) a domino on the board to cover the uncovered square, resulting in a new maximal grid-aligned configuration with another square uncovered. Let $k(C)$ be the number of distinct maximal grid-aligned configurations obtainable from $C$ by repeatedly sliding dominoes. Find the maximum value of $k(C)$ as a function of $n$.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nWe claim the answer is $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ .\n-We claim the answer is $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ .\n\nFirst, consider a checkerboard tiling of the board with 4 colors: R, G, B, Y. Number each column from $1$ to $n$ from left to right and each row from $1$ to $n$ from top to bottom. We color a tile R if its row and column are odd, a tile G is its row is even but its column is odd, a tile B if its row and column is even, and a tile Y if its row is odd but its column is even.\n\nLemma 1: Throughout our moves, the color of the uncolored tile stays an invariant.\n\nConsider that a domino can either only change rows or can only change columns. Therefore, sliding a domino into the hole and creating a new one has two possible colors. Of these, note that the new hole will always trivially be two tiles away from the old hole, meaning that the parity of both the row and column number stays the same. Thus, the lemma holds.\n\nLemma 2: There are more red tiles than any other color. Because each color is uniquely defined by the parity of a pair of column and row number, it satisfies to show that given an odd integer $n$ , there are more odd positive integers less than or equal to $n$ than even ones. Obviously, this is true, and so red will have more tiles than any other color.\n\nLemma 3: For any starting configuration $C$ and any blank tile $B$ such that the blank tile's color matches the blank tile's color of $C$ , there is no more than one unique configuration $C'$ that can be produced from $C$ using valid moves.\n\nWe will use proof by contradiction. Assume there exists two different $C'$ . We can get from one of these $C'$ to another using moves. However, we have to finish off with the same hole as before. Before the last move, the hole must be two tiles away from the starting hole. However, because the domino we used to move into the blank tile's spot is in the way, that hole must be congruent to the hole produced after the first move. We can induct this logic, and because there is a limited amount of tiles with the same color, eventually we will run out of tiles to apply this to. Therefore, having two distinct $C'$ with the same starting hole $B$ is impossible with some $C$ .\n\nWe will now prove that $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ is the answer. There are <missing 1> rows and $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ columns that are odd, and thus there are $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ red tiles. Given lemma 3, this is our upper bound for a maximum. To establish that $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ is indeed possible, we construct such a $C$ :\n\nIn the first column, leave the first tile up blank. Then, continuously fill in vertically oriented dominos in that column until it reaches the bottom. In the next $n-1$ columns, place $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ vertically oriented dominos in a row starting from the top. At the bottom row, starting with the first unfilled tile on the left, place horizontally aligned dominos in a row until you reach the right.\n\nObviously, the top left tile is red. It suffices to show that any red tile may be uncovered. For the first column, one may slide some dominos on the first column until the desired tile is uncovered. For the bottom row, all the first dominos may be slid up, and then the bottom dominos may be slid to the left until the desired red tile is uncovered. Finally, for the rest of the red tiles, the bottom red tile in the same color may be revealed, and then vertically aligned dominos in the same column may be slid down until the desired tile is revealed. Therefore, this configuration may produce $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ different configurations with moves.\n\nHence, we have proved that $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ is the maximum, and we are done.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> \\frac{n+1}{2} \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"],"ground_truth":"1"}

Remember, if you are not sure, give your best guess. \n\nThe question is:\nLet $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers, and let $N$ be a positive integer. Suppose that, for each $n > N$, $a_n$ is equal to the number of times $a_{n-1}$ appears in the list $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$.  Prove that at least one of the sequences $a_1, a_3, a_5, \\ldots$ and $a_2, a_4, a_6, \\ldots$ is eventually periodic.  (An infinite sequence $b_1, b_2, b_3, \\ldots$ is eventually periodic if there exist positive integers $p$ and $M$ such that $b_{m+p} = b_m$ for all $m \\geq M$.)\n\nThe solution is:\nLet <missing 1> . We first prove that some integer appears infinitely many times. If not, then the sequence contains arbitrarily large integers. The first time each integer larger than $M$ appears, it is followed by a 1. So 1 appears infinitely many times, which is a contradiction.  Now we prove that every integer $x \\geq M$ appears at most <missing 2> times. If not, consider the first time that any $x \\geq M$ appears for the <missing 3> time. Up to this point, each appearance of $x$ is preceded by an integer which has appeared $x \\geq M$ times. So there must have been at least $M$ numbers that have already appeared at least $M$ times before $x$ does, which is a contradiction.  Thus there are only finitely many numbers that appear infinitely many times. Let the largest of these be $k$ . Since $k$ appears infinitely many times there must be infinitely many integers greater than $M$ which appear at least $k$ times in the sequence, so each integer <missing 4> also appears infinitely many times. Since <missing 5> doesn't appear infinitely often there must only be finitely many numbers which appear more than $k$ times. Let the largest such number be <missing 6> . From here on we call an integer $x$ big if <missing 7> , medium if <missing 8> and small if <missing 9> . To summarise, each small number appears infinitely many times in the sequence, while each big number appears at most $k$ times in the sequence.  Choose a large enough <missing 10> such that $a_{N'}$ is small, and in <missing 11> : every medium number has already made all of its appearances; every small number has made more than $\\max(k, N)$ appearances.  Since every small number has appeared more than $k$ times, past this point each small number must be followed by a big number. Also, by definition each big number appears at most $k$ times, so it must be followed by a small number. Hence the sequence alternates between big and small numbers after $a_{N'}$ .  \n Lemma 1. \n Let $g$ be a big number that appears after $a_{N'}$ . If $g$ is followed by the small number $h$ , then $h$ equals the amount of small numbers which have appeared at least $g$ times before that point.\n Proof. \n By the definition of <missing 12> , the small number immediately preceding $g$ has appeared more than $\\max(k, N)$ times, so <missing 13> . And since <missing 14> , the <missing 15> appearance of every small number must occur after $a_N$ and hence is followed by $g$ . Since there are $k$ small numbers and $g$ appears at most $k$ times, $g$ must appear exactly $k$ times, always following a small number after $a_N$ . Hence on the <missing 16> appearance of $g$ , exactly $h$ small numbers have appeared at least $g$ times before that point. $\\square$ Denote by <missing 17> the subsequence <missing 18> .  \n Lemma 2. \n Suppose that $i$ and $j$ satisfy the following conditions: (a) <missing 19> , (b) <missing 20> is small and <missing 21> , (c) no small value appears more than once in $a_{[i,j-1]}$ .  Then $a_{i-2}$ is equal to some small number in $a_{[i,j-1]}$ . \n Proof. \n Let $\\mathcal{I}$ be the set of small numbers that appear at least $a_{i-1}$ times in $a_{[1,i-1]}$ . By Lemma 1, <missing 22> . Similarly, let <missing 23> be the set of small numbers that appear at least $a_{j-1}$ times in $a_{[1,j-1]}$ . Then by Lemma 1, <missing 24> and hence by (b), $|\\mathcal{I}| = |\\mathcal{J}|$ . Also by definition, <missing 25> and <missing 26> .  Suppose the small number $a_{j-2}$ is not in $\\mathcal{I}$ . This means $a_{j-2}$ has appeared less than $a_{i-1}$ times in $a_{[1,i-1]}$ . By (c), $a_{j-2}$ has appeared at most $a_{i-1}$ times in $a_{[1,j-1]}$ , hence <missing 27> . Combining with <missing 28> , this implies <missing 29> . But since <missing 30> , this contradicts $|\\mathcal{I}| = |\\mathcal{J}|$ . So <missing 31> , which means it has appeared at least $a_{i-1}$ times in $a_{[1,i-1]}$ and one more time in $a_{[i,j-1]}$ . Therefore <missing 32> .  By (c), any small number appearing at least $a_{j-1}$ times in $a_{[1,j-1]}$ has also appeared <missing 33> times in $a_{[1,i-1]}$ . So <missing 34> and hence <missing 35> . Therefore, <missing 36> , so it must appear at least <missing 37> more time in $a_{[i,j-1]}$ . $\\square$ For each small number <missing 38> with <missing 39> , let $p_n$ be the smallest number such that $a_{n+p_n} = a_i$ is also small for some $i$ with <missing 40> . In other words, $a_{n+p_n} = a_i$ is the first small number to occur twice after <missing 41> . If <missing 42> , Lemma 2 (with <missing 43> ) implies that $a_{i-2}$ appears again before <missing 44> , contradicting the minimality of $p_n$ . So <missing 45> . Lemma 2 also implies that <missing 46> . So $p_n, p_{n+2}, p_{n+4}, \\ldots$ is a nondecreasing sequence bounded above by <missing 47> (as there are only $k$ small numbers). Therefore, $p_n, p_{n+2}, p_{n+4}, \\ldots$ is eventually constant and the subsequence of small numbers is eventually periodic with period at most $k$ .\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> a_{i-2} \\in \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 2> i > n \n<expression 3> a_{j-1} \\leq a_{i-1} \n<expression 4> g^{th} \n<expression 5> h^{th} \n<expression 6> a_{n+p_n} \n<expression 7> j = n + p_n \n<expression 8> a_{j-1}-1 \\geq a_{i-1} \n<expression 9> \\mathcal{I} = \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 10> 1, 2, \\ldots, k - 1 \n<expression 11> g > \\max(k, N) \n<expression 12> l \\geq x > k \n<expression 13> p_n \\geq p_{n-2} \n<expression 14> a_i \n<expression 15> x \\leq k \n<expression 16> \\mathcal{J} \\subseteq \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 17> a_i, a_{i+1}, \\ldots, a_j \n<expression 18> M^{th} \n<expression 19> a_{[i,j]} \n<expression 20> a_{[1,i-1]} \\subset a_{[1,j-1]} \n<expression 21> a_{j-2} \\in \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 22> g > N \n<expression 23> x > l \n<expression 24> a_i = a_j \n<expression 25> N' \n<expression 26> j > i > N' + 2 \n<expression 27> a_{j-2} \\in \\mathcal{J} \\backslash \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 28> n \\leq i < n + p_n \n<expression 29> a_1, \\ldots, a_{N'} \n<expression 30> M > \\max(a_1, \\ldots, a_N) \n<expression 31> l \\geq k \n<expression 32> a_{j-2} \\in \\mathcal{I} \n<expression 33> a_{j-1} - a_{i-1} = 1 \n<expression 34> a_j = |\\mathcal{J}| \n<expression 35> N' > N \n<expression 36> 2k \n<expression 37> a_{n-1} \n<expression 38> n > N' + 2 \n<expression 39> k + 1 \n<expression 40> \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 41> \\mathcal{I} \\subseteq \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 42> a_i = |\\mathcal{I}| \n<expression 43> i = n \n<expression 44> a_{i-2} \\in \\mathcal{J} \n<expression 45> a_{j-1} > a_{i-1} \n<expression 46> M - 1 \n<expression 47> a_n \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"],"ground_truth":"30,46,18,10,39,31,23,12,15,35,29,25,11,22,4,5,19,17,26,14,24,42,40,34,1,21,3,20,41,27,32,45,8,16,9,44,33,47,38,28,37,2,7,6,43,13,36"}

Remember, if you are not sure, give your best guess. \n\nThe question is:\nA positive integer $a$ is selected, and some positive integers are written on a board. Alice and Bob play the following game. On Alice's turn, she must replace some integer $n$ on the board with $n+a$, and on Bob's turn he must replace some even integer $n$ on the board with $n\/2$. Alice goes first and they alternate turns. If on his turn Bob has no valid moves, the game ends.\n\nAfter analyzing the integers on the board, Bob realizes that, regardless of what moves Alice makes, he will be able to force the game to end eventually. Show that, in fact, for this value of $a$ and these integers on the board, the game is guaranteed to end regardless of Alice's or Bob's moves.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nThe contrapositive of the claim is somewhat easier to conceptualize: If it is not guaranteed that the game will end (i.e. the game could potentially last forever), then Bob is not able to force the game to end (i.e. Alice can force it to last forever). So we want to prove that, if the game can potentially last indefinitely, then Alice can force it to last indefinitely. Clearly, if there is $1$ number on the board initially, all moves are forced. This means the claim is true in this specific case, because if the game \"potentially\" can last forever, this means it must last forever, since the game can only be played in one way. Ergo Alice can \"force\" this to occur because it is guaranteed to occur. Now we look at all cases where there is more than $1$ number on the board.\n\n\nCase 1: $v_2 (a)=0$ The game lasts forever here no matter what. This is true because, if the game ends, it means the board was in some position $P$ , Alice added $a$ to some number on the board, and all the numbers now on the board are odd. If there are only odd numbers on the board in position $P$ , Alice will add $a$ to some number on the board, making it even, meaning this cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. If at least one number n on the board is even, Alice can add $a$ to a number other than $n$ , meaning there is still at least 1 even number on the board, meaning this also cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. This covers all possible boards when $v_2 (a)=0$ , so we're done.\n\n\nCase 2: <missing 1> If there is at least one number n on the board that is even, the game can also last forever. On any move, Alice will add $a$ to this number $n$ if and only if $v_2 (n)=1$ . This way, the new number <missing 2> satisfies $v_2 (n') \\geq 2$ . If Bob does divides $n'$ until $v_2 (n)=1$ , Alice will again add $a$ to $n$ resulting in $v_2 (n') \\geq 2$ . This means that Alice can always keep an even number on the board for Bob to divide no matter how Bob plays.\n\nIf there is no even number on the board, then the game can clearly not last forever. No matter what Alice does, Bob will have no even number to divide after her move.\n\n\nGeneral Case: <missing 3> In general, it seems to be the case that the game can last indefinitely for some given $a$ if and only if there exists some number $n$ on the board such that $v_2 (n) \\geq v_2 (a)$ , so we should aim to prove this.\n\n1. \"If\"\n\nAlice can apply a similar strategy to the strategy used in case 2. On any move, Alice will add $a$ to $n$ if and only if $v_2 (n)=v_2 (a)$ . If she does this addition, then $v_2 (n') \\geq v_2 (a)+1$ , keeping an even number on the board. Even if Bob divides $n'$ until $v_2 (n)=v_2 (a)$ , Alice will apply the same strategy and keep $v_2 (n') \\geq v_2 (a)+1$ . Alice's use of this strategy ensures that there always exists some number n on the board such that $v_2 (n) \\geq v_2 (a)$ , ensuring there always exists an even number n on the board.\n\n2.\"Only If\"\n\nIf <missing 4> for all n on the board, this means that Alice can never change the value of $v_2 (n)$ for any $n$ on the board. Only Bob can do this, and Bob will subtract $1$ from each $v_2 (n)$ until they are all equal to $0$ (all odd), ending the game.\n\nWe've shown that the game can last indefinitely iff there exists some number $n$ on the board such that $v_2 (n) \\geq v_2 (a)$ , and have shown that Alice can ensure the game lasts forever in these scenarios using the above strategy. This proves the contrapositive, proving the claim.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> n'= n+a \n<expression 2> v_2 (a)=x \n<expression 3> v_2 (n) < v_2 (a) \n<expression 4> v_2 (a)=1 \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"],"ground_truth":"4,1,2,3"}

Abbreviate <missing 2> , and WLOG assume <missing 3> .

Hence, if we define the <missing 7> variables <missing 8> for each <missing 9> then the previous expression simplifies to just <missing 10> \u00b6 Proof of bound. We split the sum into $p = q$ versus $p \\neq q$ and bound by QM-AM separately in the obvious way. For the terms $p = q$ , <missing 11>  <missing 12> . When $p \\neq q$ we instead have <missing 13>  <missing 14> .  Combining the two bounds gives <missing 15> which matches the answer claimed above.  \u00b6 Construction.

Remember, if you are not sure, give your best guess. \n\nThe question is:\nDetermine all real numbers $\\alpha$ such that, for every positive integer $n$, the integer \n $ |\\alpha| + |2\\alpha| + \\cdots + |n\\alpha| $ \n is a multiple of $n$. (Note that $[z]$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $z$. For example, $[-\\pi] = -4$ and $[2] = [2.9] = 2$.)\n\nThe solution is:\nAnswer: \n All even integers satisfy the condition of the problem and no other real number $\\alpha$ does so.  \n Solution 1. \n First we will show that even integers satisfy the condition. If <missing 1> where $m$ is an integer then <missing 2> which is a multiple of $n$ .  Now we will show that they are the only real numbers satisfying the conditions of the problem. Let <missing 3> where $k$ is an integer and $0 \\leq \\epsilon < 1$ . Then the number <missing 4>  <missing 5> has to be a multiple of $n$ . We consider two cases based on the parity of $k$ .  \n Case 1: $k$ is even. \n Then <missing 6> is always a multiple of $n$ . Thus <missing 7> also has to be a multiple of $n$ .  We will prove that $[n\\epsilon] = 0$ for every positive integer $n$ by strong induction. The base case $n = 1$ follows from the fact that $0 \\leq \\epsilon < 1$ . Let us suppose that <missing 8> for every $1 \\leq m < n$ . Then the number <missing 9> has to be a multiple of $n$ . As $0 \\leq \\epsilon < 1$ then $0 \\leq n\\epsilon < n$ , which means that the number <missing 10> has to be equal to 0.  The equality $[n\\epsilon] = 0$ implies <missing 11> . Since this has to happen for all $n$ , we conclude that <missing 12> and then $\\alpha$ is an even integer. Case 2: $k$ is odd. \n We will prove that $[n\\epsilon] = n - 1$ for every natural number $n$ by strong induction. The base case $n = 1$ again follows from the fact that $0 \\leq \\epsilon < 1$ . Let us suppose that <missing 13> for every $1 \\leq m < n$ . We need the number <missing 14>  <missing 15>  <missing 16> to be a multiple of $n$ . As $k$ is odd, we need <missing 17> to be a multiple of $n$ . Again, as $0 \\leq \\epsilon < 1$ then $0 \\leq n\\epsilon < n$ , so $[n\\epsilon] = n - 1$ as we wanted.  This implies that <missing 18> for all $n$ which is absurd.

It is clear that each <missing 3> must be $p$ , so each row represents a single residue <missing 4> .

Look at the term $a^2b+ab$ ; we claim it cannot be part of a column that has cells forming an arithmetic sequence after any appropriate rearranging. After such a rearrangement, if the column it is in has common difference <missing 7> , then <missing 8> must also be in its column, which is impossible. If the column has difference <missing 9> , then no element in the next row can be in its column.

We wish to triangulate this $n$-gon into $n-2$ triangles each colored one of $m$ colors so that each color has an equal sum of areas. For which $(m,n)$ is such a triangulation and coloring possible?\n\nThe solution is:\nThe answer is if and only if $m$ is a proper divisor of $n$ .  Throughout this solution, we let <missing 1> and let the regular $n$ -gon have vertices <missing 2> . We cache the following frequent calculation: Lemma - The triangle with vertices <missing 3> has signed area <missing 4> .  Proof. Rotate by <missing 5> to assume WLOG that <missing 6> . Apply complex shoelace to the triangles with vertices <missing 7> to get <missing 8> which equals the above. \u25a1\n\nConstruction: It suffices to actually just take all the diagonals from the vertex 1, and then color the triangles with the $m$ colors in cyclic order. To see this works one can just do the shoelace calculation: for a given residue <missing 9> , we get an area <missing 10>  <missing 11>  <missing 12>  <missing 13> .  (We allow degenerate triangles where <missing 14> with area zero.) However, if $m$ is a proper divisor of $n$ , then <missing 15> . Similarly, <missing 16> . So the inner sum vanishes, and the total area of the $m$ -th color equals <missing 17> which does not depend on the residue $r$ , proving the coloring works. \u00b6 Proof of necessity. It's obvious that <missing 18> (in fact <missing 19> ). So we focus on just showing <missing 20> .  Repeating the same calculation as above, we find that if there was a valid triangulation and coloring, the total area of each color would equal <missing 21> .  However: Claim \u2014 The number <missing 22> is not an algebraic integer when <missing 23> .  Proof. This is easiest to see if one knows the advanced result that <missing 24> is a number field whose ring of integers is known to be <missing 25> . Hence if one takes <missing 26> as a <missing 27> -basis of $K$ , then <missing 28> is the subset where each coefficient is integer. \u25a1 However, each of the quantities <missing 29> is <missing 30> times an algebraic integer.

Then the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form <missing 2> for some integer $a\\geq 1$ .\n\nTo prove this claim, note that $p$ is the smallest prime that divides $n$ , so it is the smallest divisor not equal to $1$ , meaning the first $2$ divisors are $1$ and $p$ . Furthermore, the smallest divisor of $n$ that is not equal to a power of $p$ (i.e. not equal to $(1,\\, p,\\, p^2\\dots)$ is equal to $q$ . This is because all other divisors either include a prime $z$ different from both $q$ and $p$ , which is larger than $q$ (since $q$ and $p$ are the smallest two prime divisors of $n$ ), or don\u2019t include a different prime $z$ . In the first case, since <missing 3> , the divisor is larger than $q$ . In the second case, all divisors divisible by <missing 4> are also larger than $q$ , and otherwise are of the form $p^x \\cdot q^1$ or $p^x$ for some nonnegative integer $x$ . If the divisor is of the form <missing 5> , then it is a power of $p$ . If it is of the form $p^x \\cdot q^1$ , the smallest of these factors is <missing 6> . Therefore, (in the case where $2$ or more primes divide $n$ ) the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form $(1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n)$ for some integer $a\\geq 1$ , since after each divisor <missing 7> , the next smallest divisor is either <missing 8> or simply $q$ .\n\nIf $a\\geq 2$ , the condition fails. This is because $p^{a-1} \\nmid p^a + q$ , since <missing 9> is divisible by $p^{a-1}$ , but $q$ is not since it is a prime different from $p$ . If $a=1$ , then $p^{a-1}=p^0=1$ , which does divide $q$ . Therefore $a$ must equal $1$ for the condition to be satisfied in this case. However, we know that the ordered list of divisors satisfies <missing 10> , meaning since the first $3$ divisors are <missing 11> , then the last $3$ divisors are <missing 12> , so <missing 13> must divide <missing 14> . But $\\frac{n}{q}$ is divisible by $p$ , so <missing 15> must also be divisible by $p$ , but since $a=1$  $\\frac{n}{p}$ is and $n$ isn't.\n\nWhen $n=p^x$ , it is easy to verify this works for all primes $p$ and all <missing 16> , since <missing 17> , and the divisors are ordered as ${1,\\, p,\\, p^2\u2026\\, p^x}$ .\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> p^x \n<expression 2> q^2 \n<expression 3> (\\frac{n}{q}) \n<expression 4> p<q \n<expression 5> p^x \n<expression 6> x\\geq 2 \n<expression 7> p^0 \\cdot q^1 = q \n<expression 8> p^a \n<expression 9> (\\frac{n}{p} + n) \n<expression 10> (1, p, q) \n<expression 11> p^{x+1} \n<expression 12> \\frac{n}{p} + n \n<expression 13> (1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n) \n<expression 14> p^y  \\vert  p^{y+1} + p^{y+2} \n<expression 15> d_i \\cdot d_{k+1-i}=n \n<expression 16> (\\frac{n}{q}, \\frac{n}{p}, n) \n<expression 17> z>q \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"],"ground_truth":"4,13,17,2,1,7,5,11,8,15,10,16,3,9,12,6,14"}

Alice and Bob play the following game. On Alice's turn, she must replace some integer $n$ on the board with $n+a$, and on Bob's turn he must replace some even integer $n$ on the board with $n\/2$. Alice goes first and they alternate turns. If on his turn Bob has no valid moves, the game ends.\n\nAfter analyzing the integers on the board, Bob realizes that, regardless of what moves Alice makes, he will be able to force the game to end eventually. Show that, in fact, for this value of $a$ and these integers on the board, the game is guaranteed to end regardless of Alice's or Bob's moves.\n\n\nThe solution is:\nThe contrapositive of the claim is somewhat easier to conceptualize: If it is not guaranteed that the game will end (i.e. the game could potentially last forever), then Bob is not able to force the game to end (i.e. Alice can force it to last forever). So we want to prove that, if the game can potentially last indefinitely, then Alice can force it to last indefinitely. Clearly, if there is $1$ number on the board initially, all moves are forced. This means the claim is true in this specific case, because if the game \"potentially\" can last forever, this means it must last forever, since the game can only be played in one way. Ergo Alice can \"force\" this to occur because it is guaranteed to occur. Now we look at all cases where there is more than $1$ number on the board.\n-The contrapositive of the claim is somewhat easier to conceptualize: If it is not guaranteed that the game will end (i.e. the game could potentially last forever), then Bob is not able to force the game to end (i.e. Alice can force it to last forever).

Ergo Alice can \"force\" this to occur because it is guaranteed to occur. Now we look at all cases where there is more than $1$ number on the board.\n\n\nCase 1: $v_2 (a)=0$ The game lasts forever here no matter what. This is true because, if the game ends, it means the board was in some position $P$ , Alice added $a$ to some number on the board, and all the numbers now on the board are odd. If there are only odd numbers on the board in position $P$ , Alice will add $a$ to some number on the board, making it even, meaning this cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. If at least one number n on the board is even, Alice can add $a$ to a number other than $n$ , meaning there is still at least 1 even number on the board, meaning this also cannot have been the state $P$ of the board. This covers all possible boards when <missing 1> , so we're done.\n\n\nCase 2: $v_2 (a)=1$ If there is at least one number n on the board that is even, the game can also last forever. On any move, Alice will add $a$ to this number $n$ if and only if <missing 2> . This way, the new number <missing 3> satisfies $v_2 (n') \\geq 2$ . If Bob does divides <missing 4> until $v_2 (n)=1$ , Alice will again add $a$ to $n$ resulting in <missing 5> . This means that Alice can always keep an even number on the board for Bob to divide no matter how Bob plays.\n\nIf there is no even number on the board, then the game can clearly not last forever. No matter what Alice does, Bob will have no even number to divide after her move.\n\n\nGeneral Case: $v_2 (a)=x$ In general, it seems to be the case that the game can last indefinitely for some given $a$ if and only if there exists some number $n$ on the board such that $v_2 (n) \\geq v_2 (a)$ , so we should aim to prove this.\n\n1. \"If\"\n\nAlice can apply a similar strategy to the strategy used in case 2. On any move, Alice will add $a$ to $n$ if and only if $v_2 (n)=v_2 (a)$ . If she does this addition, then $v_2 (n') \\geq v_2 (a)+1$ , keeping an even number on the board. Even if Bob divides <missing 6> until <missing 7> , Alice will apply the same strategy and keep $v_2 (n') \\geq v_2 (a)+1$ . Alice's use of this strategy ensures that there always exists some number n on the board such that $v_2 (n) \\geq v_2 (a)$ , ensuring there always exists an even number n on the board.\n\n2.\"Only If\"\n\nIf $v_2 (n) < v_2 (a)$ for all n on the board, this means that Alice can never change the value of <missing 8> for any $n$ on the board. Only Bob can do this, and Bob will subtract $1$ from each <missing 9> until they are all equal to $0$ (all odd), ending the game.\n\nWe've shown that the game can last indefinitely iff there exists some number $n$ on the board such that <missing 10> , and have shown that Alice can ensure the game lasts forever in these scenarios using the above strategy. This proves the contrapositive, proving the claim.\n\nThe formulae are:\n<expression 1> n' \n<expression 2> n'= n+a \n<expression 3> v_2 (n) \n<expression 4> v_2 (n') \\geq 2 \n<expression 5> v_2 (n) \\geq v_2 (a) \n<expression 6> v_2 (n)=1 \n<expression 7> v_2 (n)=v_2 (a) \n<expression 8> n' \n<expression 9> v_2 (a)=0 \n<expression 10> v_2 (n) \n\n\nYour final answer should be STRICTLY in the format:\n\n<Detailed reasoning>\n\nAnswer: <comma separated list of numbers representing expression identifiers>"],"ground_truth":"9,6,2,1,4,8,7,3,10,5"}

The array sick contains the positions of the children who are infected with an infectious disease. An infected child at position i can spread the disease to either of its immediate neighboring children at positions i - 1 and i + 1 if they exist and are currently not infected. At most one child who was previously not infected can get infected with the disease in one second.\nIt can be shown that after a finite number of seconds, all the children in the queue will get infected with the disease. An infection sequence is the sequential order of positions in which all of the non-infected children get infected with the disease. Return the total number of possible infection sequences.\nSince the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.\nNote that an infection sequence does not contain positions of children who were already infected with the disease in the beginning.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 5, sick = [0,4]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Children at positions 1, 2, and 3 are not infected in the beginning. There are 4 possible infection sequences:\n- The children at positions 1 and 3 can get infected since their positions are adjacent to the infected children 0 and 4. The child at position 1 gets infected first.\nNow, the child at position 2 is adjacent to the child at position 1 who is infected and the child at position 3 is adjacent to the child at position 4 who is infected, hence either of them can get infected. The child at position 2 gets infected.\nFinally, the child at position 3 gets infected because it is adjacent to children at positions 2 and 4 who are infected. The infection sequence is [1,2,3].\n- The children at positions 1 and 3 can get infected because their positions are adjacent to the infected children 0 and 4. The child at position 1 gets infected first.\nNow, the child at position 2 is adjacent to the child at position 1 who is infected and the child at position 3 is adjacent to the child at position 4 who is infected, hence either of them can get infected. The child at position 3 gets infected.\nFinally, the child at position 2 gets infected because it is adjacent to children at positions 1 and 3 who are infected. The infection sequence is [1,3,2].\n- The infection sequence is [3,1,2]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4].\n- The infection sequence is [3,2,1].

The price of a number num is the number of i's such that i % x == 0 and s[i] is a set bit.\nReturn the greatest integer num such that the sum of prices of all numbers from 1 to num is less than or equal to k.\nNote:\n\nIn the binary representation of a number set bit is a bit of value 1.\nThe binary representation of a number will be indexed from right to left.

So the sum of their prices is 2.\nThe second bit of binary representation of numbers 6 and 7 is a set bit. So the sum of their prices is 2.\nThe fourth bit of binary representation of numbers 8 and 9 is a set bit but their second bit is not. So the sum of their prices is 2.\nNumbers 1, 4, and 5 don't have set bits in their even^th bits in their binary representation. So the sum of their prices is 0.\nThe second and the fourth bit of the binary representation of the number 10 are a set bit.

The remaining characters (if any) in s maintain their initial order.\n\nBefore the operations, you are allowed to change at most one index in s to another lowercase English letter.\nReturn an integer denoting the maximum number of resulting partitions after the operations by optimally choosing at most one index to change.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"accca\", k = 2\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: In this example, to maximize the number of resulting partitions, s[2] can be changed to 'b'.\ns becomes \"acbca\".\nThe operations can now be performed as follows until s becomes empty:\n- Choose the longest prefix containing at most 2 distinct characters, \"acbca\".\n- Delete the prefix, and s becomes \"bca\". The number of partitions is now 1.\n- Choose the longest prefix containing at most 2 distinct characters, \"bca\".\n- Delete the prefix, and s becomes \"a\". The number of partitions is now 2.\n- Choose the longest prefix containing at most 2 distinct characters, \"a\".\n- Delete the prefix, and s becomes empty. The number of partitions is now 3.\nHence, the answer is 3.\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to obtain more than 3 partitions.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"aabaab\", k = 3\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: In this example, to maximize the number of resulting partitions we can leave s as it is.\nThe operations can now be performed as follows until s becomes empty: \n- Choose the longest prefix containing at most 3 distinct characters, \"aabaab\".\n- Delete the prefix, and s becomes empty.

The number of partitions is now 1.\n- Choose the longest prefix containing at most 1 distinct character, \"ayz\".\n- Delete the prefix, and s becomes \"yz\". The number of partitions is now 2.\n- Choose the longest prefix containing at most 1 distinct character, \"yz\".\n- Delete the prefix, and s becomes \"z\". The number of partitions is now 3.\n- Choose the longest prefix containing at most 1 distinct character, \"z\".\n- Delete the prefix, and s becomes empty.

You will NOT return anything except for the second part of the program that you wrote.\n### Question:\nYou are given two 0-indexed strings source and target, both of length n and consisting of lowercase English letters. You are also given two 0-indexed character arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of changing the character original[i] to the character changed[i].\nYou start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a character x from the string and change it to the character y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y.\nReturn the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.\nNote that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: source = \"abcd\", target = \"acbe\", original = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"c\",\"e\",\"d\"], changed = [\"b\",\"c\",\"b\",\"e\",\"b\",\"e\"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]\nOutput: 28\nExplanation: To convert the string \"abcd\" to string \"acbe\":\n- Change value at index 1 from 'b' to 'c' at a cost of 5.\n- Change value at index 2 from 'c' to 'e' at a cost of 1.\n- Change value at index 2 from 'e' to 'b' at a cost of 2.\n- Change value at index 3 from 'd' to 'e' at a cost of 20.\nThe total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.\nIt can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: source = \"aaaa\", target = \"bbbb\", original = [\"a\",\"c\"], changed = [\"c\",\"b\"], cost = [1,2]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: To change the character 'a' to 'b' change the character 'a' to 'c' at a cost of 1, followed by changing the character 'c' to 'b' at a cost of 2, for a total cost of 1 + 2 = 3. To change all occurrences of 'a' to 'b', a total cost of 3 * 4 = 12 is incurred.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: source = \"abcd\", target = \"abce\", original = [\"a\"], changed = [\"e\"], cost = [10000]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: It is impossible to convert source to target because the value at index 3 cannot be changed from 'd' to 'e'.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= source.length == target.length <= 10^5\nsource, target consist of lowercase English letters.\n1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 2000\noriginal[i], changed[i] are lowercase English letters.\n1 <= cost[i] <= 10^6\noriginal[i] != changed[i]\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def minimumCost(self, source, target, original, changed, cost):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type source: str\n        :type target: str\n        :type original: List[str]\n        :type changed: List[str]\n        :type cost: List[int]\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        INF = float(\"inf\")\n        def dijkstra(start):\n            best = {start:0}\n            min_heap = [(0, start)]\n            while min_heap:\n                curr, u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)\n                if curr > best[u]:\n                    continue\n                if u not in dist:\n                    continue\n                for v, w in dist[u].items():     \n                    if v in best and best[v] <= curr+w:\n                        continue\n                    best[v] = curr+w\n                    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (best[v], v))\n            return best\n\n        memo = {}\n        def memoization(u, v):\n            if u not in memo:\n                memo[u] = dijkstra(u)\n            return memo[u][v] if v in memo[u] else INF\n\n        dist = {}\n        for i in range(len(original)):\n            u, v = ord(original[i])-ord('a'), ord(changed[i])-ord('a')\n```\n\n### Answer: (enclose your partial completion in backticks.

So the answer is 4.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [4,3,2,6]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Replacing [3,2] with [5] converts the given array to [4,5,6] that is non-decreasing.\nBecause the given array is not non-decreasing, the maximum possible answer is 3.\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 10^5\n1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution(object):\n    def findMaximumLength(self, nums):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type nums: List[int]\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        dp = prefix = left = 0\n        stk = [(0, 0, 0)]\n        for right in range(len(nums)):\n            prefix += nums[right]\n            while left+1 < len(stk) and stk[left+1][0] <= prefix:\n                left += 1\n            last, dp = prefix-stk[left][1], stk[left][2]+1\n            while stk and stk[-1][0] >= last+prefix:\n                stk.pop()\n```\n\n### Answer: (enclose your partial completion in backticks.

In the present day, the Waller family-Ray, Eve, and children Izzy and Elliot-are seeking a new, permanent residence after Ray has been forced to retire from his baseball career due to illness. Eve returns to the house to find that Ray is being directly controlled by the entity, which traps Elliot in the pool and attempts to kill Izzy. Deciding to remain in the house so that no one else falls victim to the entity, Eve, Izzy and Elliot make arrangements for the pool to be filled in to stop such a thing happening again. However, Eve becomes concerned at the changes she sees in her husband. Eve tries to save her son while Izzy confronts the entity possessing her father, eventually assaulting him with a baseball bat. Once back in the yard, Izzy's assault and Elliot's condition help Ray regain control of himself. When the pool maintenance come to inspect it, they reveal that the pool is essentially self-sustaining, taking its water from an underground spring in the area. While she tries to get the boat, something in the pool pulls her underwater. In 1992, a young girl, Rebecca Summers, goes out to her family pool one night to retrieve a toy boat belonging to her terminally ill brother, Tommy. Eve is horrified to realize that Ray is now being healed by the pool but it will take one of the children as a sacrifice. Tracking down the Summers family after learning that there is a long history of disappearances in the house, Eve meets with Lucy, Rebecca's mother.

Once back in the yard, Izzy's assault and Elliot's condition help Ray regain control of himself. To stop the entity attacking his children, Ray sacrifices himself to it. Deciding to remain in the house so that no one else falls victim to the entity, Eve, Izzy and Elliot make arrangements for the pool to be filled in to stop such a thing happening again."}

The real gold shipment was parachuted out of the A-380 into the Swiss Alps while it was approaching the Cortina landing strip. Weeks later, Cyrus reveals to Abby that the crew stole the gold shipment during the heist on the airliner, replacing the actual shipment with iron bars painted to look like gold. Interpol agent Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a former fling of Cyrus, uncovers evidence implicating Denton, in the theft and arrests him. The crew determines they will only be able to steal the gold while the airliner is in mid-air. Luke was never out; he guided the parachute to a recoverable spot in the mountains via remote control. As Leviathan requires payment of $500 million in untraceable gold bullion, Jorgenson has arranged for a shipment of gold to be taken from his vault in London and flown to Leviathan's bank in Zurich via a commercial airliner. Huxley wants Cyrus and his crew to intercept this gold payment to Leviathan. Huxley cannot intercept the gold as it is a legal transaction. N8 decides to celebrate with the team after being promised a cut of the money ($27 million). Harry then calls the A-380 pilots and diverts them to Cortina due to heavy weather in Zurich. Cyrus and his team successfully divert the plane. After Magnus cracks the safe and Jorgenson's henchmen are incapacitated, the crew will extract the gold from the A-380 once it lands in the Swiss Alps. This mask will create the NFT, with a live 30-second feed from the auction itself. Together, the crew recover their gold haul and celebrate their success while Cyrus and Abby kindle their relationship. Lars was responsible for making millions by shorting airlines stock, after the crash of a New Zealand plane that killed 189 people. To do so, they procure a private jet from a rich private art collector named Molsen that Camila will fly directly underneath the airliner, allowing Mi-Sun to switch the radar signals to make it seem like the plane is still on course while the crew diverts it to a private airfield. The team staged a kidnapping for N8 and Cyrus points out that famous paintings rapidly increase in value after being stolen and he says that his crew stole the Van Gogh painting and sold it in the black market for $20 million to buy N8 NFTs. They undertake two simultaneous thefts, stealing a Van Gogh painting in London while staging the fake kidnapping of renowned NFT artist N8 (Jacob Batalon) in Venice. Mi-Sun says that the chances of turning on the signal Jammer on the A-380 and the transponder on the private jet (to mimic the A-380's signal) are next to zero. Magnus escapes on the ground, while the remaining three are taken aboard the Molsen jet with the gold, headed for Jorgenson's estate in Tuscany. Harry agrees to help Cyrus against a payment of a million dollars. Once complete, the NFT will have captured the moment of its sale, which will include the buyer. Cyrus knows that Lars is a dangerous man and not to be trifled with, but Abby lures him in with an offer of full immunity for him and his entire crew, As part of the deal, Cyrus insists Abby join the team to provide certain cover for Interpol. Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured at gunpoint by Jorgenson, who also executes Leviathan's representative after they decide to cancel the deal. Their timing is complicated when Jorgenson executes a mole Arthur Tigue (Jess Liaudin) in his organization and moves up the delivery date. Cyrus argues that with Abby on the team Interpol will not hang the team out to dry if things do not go as per plan. Desperate for the gold to not reach Jorgenson, Huxley orders the plane shot down by NATO. Camila pilots the Molsen jet under the A-380, Abby assembles and turns on the signal Jammer on the A-380, while Camila turns on the transponder to mimic the A-380 signal. The NFT by N8 is made by a self portrait mask comprising of 482 cameras. Harry (David Proud), the crew's contact at air traffic control, works with Camila (who was piloting the Molsen jet) to get a message to the NATO fighter pilots that there are hostages on board the A-380, forcing them to stand down. Nevertheless, the crew is ready on time. Out of UK airspace, Brussels ATC will be tracking the flight, and Abby has a contact there who will help them. Camila puts the transponder on a drone headed to Zurich and follows the A-380 to Cortina. She resigns from Interpol and joins Cyrus. Now Huxley has a mole in Lars's organization named Arthur Tigue. Magnus, Abby, Cyrus, and Camila are captured. Jorgenson's henchmen (including Cormac (Burn Gorman) & Donal (Paul Anderson)) attempt a hijack, resulting in the plane crash landing at Cortina, followed by Camila landing the Molsen jet at the airport. It will be loaded onto a Sky Suisse A-380 passenger plane to Zurich. Another fight between the crew and Jorgenson's henchmen results in the jet crash landing on the grounds of Jorgenson's villa. The Carabinieri arrive, and Cyrus uses N8's NFT technology to show them a recording of Jorgenson murdering the representative. The gold weighs ten tons and will be delivered to Heathrow airport under armored cover. Rather than proceed with charges against the crew, Abby's superior, Commander Huxley (Sam Worthington), leverages their legal predicament to force them to help capture billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno), who intends to make more money by working with the hacking group Leviathan to stage a massive flooding in Europe, allowing him to make billions in profit through stock manipulation. Denton was seen at the auction and Abby correctly deduced that his limp was a fake. After being 'kidnapped', N8's NFT ballooned in value to $89 million. N8 was in Venice to auction a single edition NFT. In exchange for loaning his private jet, Cyrus promises Molsen to persuade N8 to make a special NFT art for him.

With a new parameter $0<\\alpha\\leq 1$, the $\\alpha$-generalized no-scale supergravity provides the continuous connections among the generic no-scale supergravity from string theory compactifications. The resulting prediction of the CMB, spectrum index $n_s$, and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ can be highly consistent with the latest Planck\/BICEP\/Keck Array observations. Notably, the models with $\\alpha\\neq 1$ give a smaller ratio $r\\leq 10^{-3}$, which is flexible even under the anticipated tighter observational constraints at the future experiments. Additionally, these models have the potential to generate a broad-band stochastic gravitational wave background, and thus explain the NANOGrav 15yr signal. Furthermore, they predict the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) with various mass scales, which could account for a significant portion of dark matter relic density in the Universe."}

Eighteen months later, Colt, now a valet for a small Mexican restaurant, is contacted by Gail Meyer, Tom's film producer. He retrieves the recording and falls onto a crash mat prepared by Dan, while the helicopter crashes with Gail and Tom in it. Metalstorm's trailer premieres at San Diego Comic-Con, with Jason Momoa replacing Tom as the lead, and the film eventually becomes a box-office hit. In a flashback, prop crew members dressed as police surround Gail and Tom, prompting Tom to run towards stunt pyrotechnics while trying to phone his agent, accidentally blowing himself up. Meanwhile, as production of Metalstorm continues, Colt and Jody begin to rekindle their relationship until Gail abruptly informs him that he must return to the United States. Instead, he continues looking for Tom by tracking down his PA Alma Milan. Colt Seavers, a Hollywood stunt performer, works as the stunt double for famous action star Tom Ryder. She tells him that Jody is directing her first film, a science fiction epic titled Metalstorm, and wants Colt to join the production in Sydney. Henry's body is discovered and the doctored video is released on news media, while Gail tries to convince Jody that Colt is guilty. She gives him a lead, so he visits a nightclub, where he meets drug dealer Doone, who tricks Colt into drinking a cocktail laced with hallucinogenic drugs. Colt defeats them after an extended chase through Sydney, involving a rubbish truck. The next day, Tom arrives at the Metalstorm set with his goons and the production continues. They are both attacked by people looking for a phone belonging to Tom in Alma's possession. However, he is severely injured during a stunt gone wrong and he abandons his career and his girlfriend Jody Moreno, a camerawoman. Not wanting Jody's directorial debut ruined, Colt starts to track down Tom. He reveals that Gail is framing Colt for the crime using deepfake technology to replace Tom's face with Colt's on the incriminating video. Dan escapes, but Colt is captured and brought face-to-face with Tom, who has been hiding out on a yacht on Gail's instructions. He first goes to Tom's apartment where he is \u2018attacked\u2019 by Tom's girlfriend Iggy. Gail reveals that Tom has disappeared after getting into trouble with drug dealers, and she wants Colt to find him before his absence causes the already overbudget film's cancelation. They discover a video of an intoxicated Tom accidentally killing his previous stuntman Henry Herrera. After getting into a fight with the drug dealer's goons, he visits Tom's hotel room where he finds a dead body in a bathtub full of ice. Colt gets exonerated, and he and Jody get back together. The rest of the crew, led by Dan, hold off his goons. After arriving on set, Colt learns that Jody never asked for him and is still angry about their breakup, with the film being a less-than-subtle attempt at airing her grievances at Colt. Colt escapes and is presumed dead after a boat chase, though he swims to safety. Tom also reveals that he orchestrated both Colt's and Henry's \u2018accidents\u2019 over his resentment of them thinking he's cowardly for not wanting to do his own stunts. Gail steals the recording at gunpoint and tries to escape in a helicopter with Tom, but Jody helps Colt leap onto the helicopter in mid-air. Colt secretly returns to the set and convinces Jody of his innocence. When Colt returns with the police, he finds the body has disappeared. Together, they trick Tom into participating in a stunt sequence and into confessing while he is wired with a lav mike.

After performing, Marley, saddened that his own countrymen would try to kill him and his wife, shows the crowd his bullet wounds before walking off stage. After Marley debuts a song to Rita and the children about reconciliation, she finally deems him ready to perform a peace concert. A pre-credits montage shows clips of the real Marley and his band during the One Love Peace Concert, which sees them joined on-stage by the heads of both of Jamaica's political parties, also revealing that Marley and his band were able to perform in Zimbabwe to celebrate the nation's independence before he died of his cancer in 1981 at the age of 36. Marley also gets into an altercation with manager Don Taylor over a financial dispute. After a toenail infection raises concern from Rita and his record producer Chris Blackwell, Marley is later diagnosed with a rare skin cancer. Back home, the gunman who had shot him and the others arrives and begs for forgiveness, to which Marley states he \u2018keeps no vengeance\u2019. He tells Rita to take their children to Delaware in the United States and stay with his mom, as he and the rest of his band venture to London. In 1976, amidst armed political conflict that is affecting daily life in Jamaica, Bob Marley announces he will perform at a concert, Smile Jamaica, promoting peace amongst the warring factions. Blackwell confronts Marley about treatment choices, reluctantly dismissed by a firm Marley. While preparing for the concert, Marley, his wife Rita, and several other members of his band are shot by assailants. After struggling to come up with a new album concept, Marley asks Rita to rejoin him and the band in England, and taking inspiration from the soundtrack of the film Exodus and their own situation, he and the band begin recording what would become their album of the same name. This leads to friction with Rita as she and Marley argue about his responsibilities and both his and Rita's infidelities, in addition to having given up on promoting peace back in Jamaica. When the recording company schedules a tour in Europe, Marley also aims for stops throughout Africa to inspire the people there. Faced with his own mortality, Marley reconciles with Rita and Taylor and finally decides to return to Jamaica in 1978, where he is welcomed back by a crowd at the airport. Rita and Marley are hospitalized, but survive and recover from their injuries in time for the concert.

They are scared to go inside the hole to retrieve him. They try lowering the rope, for Subhash to hold, but are sceptical that he may not be in a situation to hold on to the rope after a deep fall. Kuttan is able to retrieve him and the rest of the friends pull them up together successfully. They are also accused of murdering Subhash and giving false complaints and no help is offered. After etching it on the wall, the friends call out to show the remaining guys who are exploring on the other sides to take a picture and they all regroup. On the way, he informs them that the last person who fell into the hole was the former Central Minister's nephew around ten years ago and all the forces had gotten together to rescue him, but no one had been able to. Finally after being convinced, and fearing backlash from the local people for failing to help, one of the police officers agrees to go with them to the cave. After the initial shock, a few of them run back to get help and others stay and continue calling out to him in hopes that he would respond. After receiving first aid from the nearest clinic, they take Subhash to the hospital in their hometown, where he is treated more thoroughly. Seeing this, one of the friends, Siju David, decides to go down. Later, the news that Kuttan saved Subhash comes out from a person who went to Tamil Nadu and Kuttan is applauded for his bravery. In 2006, a group of 10 friends from an arts club in Kochi leave on a trip to Kodaikanal in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu, during the Onam vacation. Upon reaching a point, a few friends decide to etch down their group name \u2018Manjummel Boys\u2019 on the rocks within the cave. The police arrange for more rope and reel Kuttan down further. They mention that the British had called Guna Caves as The Devil's Kitchen due to this reason and that the particular hole is over 900 feet deep. They explore Kodaikanal and before leaving, one of the friends, Sudhi tells them about Guna Caves, a place where the film Gunaa was shot. They estimate that Subhash has fallen down into a depth of around 120 feet. The police officers are initially reluctant, but finally agree after being convinced by the friends and the locals. At 120 feet, Kuttan is able to see Subhash barely lying on a ledge covered in blood and muddy water due to the rain. Inebriated, high and happy, the friends reach Guna Caves and decide to explore the restricted areas of the caves by themselves despite a warning from Dominic, a tourist guide. However, Kuttan states that he can hear Subhash's voice clearly and that he cannot leave him down there. They decide not to tell anyone about the incident and tells Subhash's family that he fell in a waterfall. They inform the locals of what happened and ask them for help, and they all suggest going to the police station and forest guard. But soon one of the boys, Sixen hears Subhash's cries and informs others that he is alive and the police are also convinced to try and save him. Initially everyone assumes he is pulling a prank, but as he does not respond even after calling out to him multiple times, they all start to panic. Though there are signs of a lurking danger, the friends explore further. Subhash suffers trauma from the fall and is not able to sleep initially, but slowly starts recovering after going to trauma therapy. The police officer, after inspecting the hole, suggests that they leave Subhash as he probably is no longer alive, but the friends are adamant about rescuing him.

With their supply and aid ships constantly sunk by German submarines, Brigadier Colin Gubbins, with the indirect backing of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, prepares to initiate Operation Postmaster, an off the books black-ops sabotage mission intended to disrupt the Nazis' U-boat resupply operation on the Spanish-controlled island Fernando Po. Meanwhile, arriving early on Fernando Po, Marjorie and Heron use the latter's 'illegal' gambling hall to recruit backup for Gus' team while Marjorie seduces Heinrich Luhr, the SS commander in charge. Using the neutral Swedish fishing trawler Maid of Honor, Gus and his allies, Graham Hayes, Freddy Alvarez, and Danish naval officer Anders Lassen (the only non-British subject to be awarded the Victoria Cross), begin the slow sail to Fernando Po. Barely warned of this in time, Gus and Appleyard decide that their best course of action is to hijack the ships and use them as a bartering chip after a mole in Gubbins' staff reveals the mission to senior command. While waiting to be court-martialed, they are saved and recruited by Churchill as part of his 'Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare', as their actions have not only severely damaged the Nazis' naval strength, but also have allowed the United States, who recently entered the war following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, to join the European theatre. Delivering the boats to a British fleet outside Lagos, the team is nonetheless arrested. Upon discovering that SOE saboteur Geoffrey Appleyard, whom Gubbins had sent ahead on the assumption that Gus would show interest in wanting him on the team, was captured by Gestapo agents, they divert course to a Nazi-controlled section of the Canary Islands for a rescue mission. While SOE agents Marjorie Stewart and Richard Heron depart by train, Gubbins enlists Gus March-Phillips to assemble a ground team to destroy the Italian supply ship Duchessa d'Aosta and two tugboats attached to it. In late 1941, during World War II the United Kingdom is struggling to halt Nazi Germany's attempts to take over Europe, with London regularly suffering bombing runs at the hands of the Luftwaffe. A montage of details before the end credits reveal the post operation activities of several protagonists: Gus became a war hero and would helm several similar raids during the war before marrying Marjorie at the start of her acting career; Appleyard would receive several commendations for his role in the mission, much to the king's amusement; Hayes would go on to become a highly accomplished spy notable for surviving a year of Nazi torture without breaking; Lassen would go on to take part in raids outside the group until his death in 1945; Ian Fleming, who had been part of Gubbins' inner circle during this time, would use Operation Postmaster as the inspirational basis for his James Bond novels. Upon learning that the Duchessa intends to depart three days ahead of schedule, Gus has his crew sail through a British naval blockade of Nazi-occupied West Africa despite knowing they'll be arrested should their unauthorized mission be discovered.

Kinney and Sweet raid one of Sayyaf's facilities before being captured and taken to their prison. The base crew, distracted by a March Madness game, dismisses Kinney's call and redirects him to Grimm's private phone. Captain Eddie \u2018Reaper\u2019 Grimm, a US Air Force drone pilot, supported by Staff Sergeant Nia Branson, provides air support from a Reaper to a US Army Delta Force team sent to rescue a CIA spy in the southern Philippines.

Grimm does not answer, being in a call with his very pregnant wife while grocery shopping, so Kinney leaves a voice mail, and leaves seeking the other prisoners. Sweet is executed right as the first superficial bombing hits, and Kinney is taken to be tortured, where the rebel leader does not believe his warning about the upcoming bombings. As no one answers, Grimm is forced to rush to the control room and order the B-1 Lancer pilot to abort the bombing, right as it flies in front of Kinney, Bishop, and the CIA agent reaching the cave's entrance. Once Kinney arrives, he is intercepted by the Abu Sayyaf, depleting the ammunition of Grimm's drone (consisting of AGM-114 Hellfire and BLU-118 rockets) and forcing the endangered extraction helicopter to leave. When the bombs hit, Kinney survives due to having been dunked in a water tub, while his captors are caught in the flames. Returning to Bishop and searching for a way out, they also find the CIA operative, whom Grimm and Branson had been lied to that he was found elsewhere by another agency's operation. Afterwards he convenes with Branson in a hangar, where she asks him to walk her down the aisle in her wedding, and he agrees and leads her in a dance. Kinney grabs a machete and kills the surviving leader, taking his satellite phone and calling Nellis Air Force Base for Grimm to call off the third bombing, before the battery runs out. As the soldiers are finally extracted in the Philippines, Grimm complains to the rest of the base crew and his superiors that three men nearly died because they were too distracted to hear their calls, despite being repeatedly asked to pay attention to the phone because of his pregnant wife, and he smashes the break room's main television in anger.

Alida and Taroo, an ancient Puerto Rican legend about two star-crossed lovers from feuding tribes, has greatly influenced Artist's opinions on love and romance. They conclude that in order for her to break her romantic cycle, she must rise above her physical self by embarking on a self-love journey without their assistance. While Artist continues with her ill-advised lifestyle, her friends stage an intervention.

Hoping to lure Godzilla to Hollow Earth to assist him, Kong surfaces in Cairo and calls out to Godzilla. Despite Kong's attempts to communicate, Godzilla attacks him, and a brief fight ensues until Mothra intervenes. Inspecting some ruins, they surmise that the signal was a telepathic distress call sent by the Iwi.

On Earth's surface, Godzilla continues to maintain order between humanity and giant monsters, known as \u2018Titans\u2019 \u2014 killing Titan Scylla in Rome and resting in the Colosseum afterwards. A Monarch observation outpost stationed in Hollow Earth picks up an unidentified signal. On the surface, the signal causes Jia, the last known survivor of the Iwi tribe from Skull Island, to experience hallucinations and visions, causing her adoptive mother and Kong expert, Dr. Ilene Andrews, to worry. Also sensing the signal, Godzilla leaves Rome and attacks a nuclear plant in France to absorb radiation. He then heads to the lair of the Titan Tiamat in the Arctic. Monarch believes Godzilla is strengthening himself for an oncoming threat. When a sinkhole opens near his home, Kong discovers an uncharted realm where a tribe of his species has survived, including a juvenile named Suko. After a brief initial confrontation, Kong convinces Suko to lead him to the tribe's lair, and the two slowly bond on their journey. The tribe's tyrannical leader, Skar King, battles Kong with the aid of an ancient ice-powered Titan, Shimo, whom he controls with pain using a crystal. Shimo's ice breath injures Kong's right arm, causing frostbite, but with Suko's help, Kong manages to escape after losing his axe. Andrews and Jia, alongside Titan veterinarian Trapper and conspiracy podcaster Bernie Hayes, travel to Hollow Earth to locate the source of the signal. They find the Monarch outpost destroyed. As the group follows the signal, they discover a temple that leads them to a subterranean section that houses a surviving Iwi tribe, who communicate telepathically with each other, living beneath portals to the surface. Inspecting some ruins, they surmise that the signal was a telepathic distress call sent by the Iwi. While observing Jia socializing with the Iwi, Andrews voices her fears to Trapper that Jia may choose to stay with her people and that Andrews would have to accept it. Inside a temple, Andrews uncovers hieroglyphics displaying the past and future: Skar King once attempted to conquer the surface world, forced Shimo to trigger an ice age, and waged war against Godzilla's species, but Godzilla defeated him by trapping him and his tribe deep within Hollow Earth. The prophecy also indicates that Jia would be the key to reawakening Mothra. Sensing Jia, Kong locates the temple and is fitted by Trapper with a prototype exoskeletal glove to strengthen and heal his frostbitten limb. Unknown to them, one of Skar King's loyalists follows them and informs him that the protective barrier leading to the surface portals has been opened. Jia successfully awakens the reborn Mothra. Meanwhile, Godzilla kills Tiamat and absorbs cosmic radiation from her lair, which turns his dorsal plates magenta. Hoping to lure Godzilla to Hollow Earth to assist him, Kong surfaces in Cairo and calls out to Godzilla. Despite Kong's attempts to communicate, Godzilla attacks him, and a brief fight ensues until Mothra intervenes. Godzilla, Kong, and Mothra return to the Hollow Earth and engage Skar King and Shimo in battle. Skar King and Shimo manage to use one of the portals to escape to the surface, forcing Godzilla and Kong to chase them to Rio de Janeiro, and Shimo induces a second ice age at Skar King's command. The factions are evenly matched until Suko arrives with Kong's axe and destroys the crystal controlling Shimo. Shimo freezes Skar King before Kong shatters him to pieces. After undoing Shimo's ice age with his atomic breath, Godzilla returns to rest in the Colosseum. Jia reunites with Andrews and alleviates her fears by choosing to stay with her adopted mother. Mothra restores the protective barrier of the Iwi's home and the portals. Kong returns with Shimo and Suko to Hollow Earth, where he becomes the ape tribe's new leader."}

During one such attack, the Rig's crew are wiped out, leaving its commander, Praetorian Jack, and Furiosa as the only survivors. Haunted by the death of his family, he adopts Furiosa as his daughter, hoping that she will lead him to the Green Place. One night, Rictus breaks Furiosa out of the vault to make sexual advances toward her; using a wig made from her own hair, she slips from his grasp and disappears.

Furiosa becomes Jack's second-in-command and is promoted to Praetorian; the two bond and resolve to escape together one day. Dementus changes course, using a Trojan Horse strategy to capture Gastown, an oil refinery that supplies the Citadel with gasoline. At peace negotiations, Joe agrees to recognize Dementus's authority over Gastown and increase its supplies of food and water in exchange for the Horde's physician and Furiosa. Immortan Joe decides to attack Gastown, as Dementus's mismanagement has led the facility to near-ruin. Dementus forces Furiosa to watch her mother's crucifixion. Years after a global catastrophe, Australia is a radioactive wasteland and the Green Place of Many Mothers is one of the last remaining areas with fresh water and agriculture. However, Dementus, having preemptively attacked and captured the Bullet Farm, ambushes the War Rig on arrival; Furiosa and Jack barely escape, and Furiosa's left arm is severely injured. After an extended chase, she captures him in the desert. Dementus eventually chases them down and tortures Jack to death. Dementus taunts her, saying revenge will not make her whole. Furiosa attempts to sabotage their motorbikes, but the raiders capture her as a prize for their leader, warlord Dementus of the Biker Horde. After receiving a tip from a stranded soldier, Dementus and the Biker Horde besiege the Citadel, another Wasteland settlement with fresh water and agriculture.

Aju and Bibi are unable to clear their exams by failing in one subject, while Shanthan passes them. They are unable to focus on their studies. In retaliation, Kutty and his gang forcefully take the trio to his place and brutally thrash them, only to offer friendship afterward. The trio meets Ranga and tries to express their desire to sever ties with him, revealing that they only befriended him for revenge but hold back when they see Ranga threaten to kill two of his gang members trying to leave the gang. Feeling humiliated, Aju seeks revenge and leads his friends to multiple bars in search of gangsters, eventually befriending Ranga, a prominent, eccentric and kind-hearted Malayali-Kannadiga gangster who dresses in all-white. One day after the trio gets drunk, Ranga takes them in their jeep to drop them off at their hostel, but the hostel warden warns them not to arrive late as there are rules in the hostel. Fleeing from Reddy's threats they go back to their house. Initially, they enjoy their time there until a confrontation with Kutty, a senior student, escalates, bruising his ego. Disillusioned by Ranga's lack of action, they realize his gang merely praises him while engaging in minor violence. They encounter Ranga, now clad in all-black attire as new look, outside the college. So Ranga takes them to his old house, where the trio finds a grim truth in the house. The boys finally decide to confront Ranga and make up a plan to call Reddy when he is alone. Distraught at their betrayal, Ranga faces Reddy's gang alone and emerges victorious, revealing that he kept the boys with him as no one had gotten close to him in his life unless they needed something from him. Aju, Bibi and Shanthan arrive in Bangalore, Karnataka from Kerala to pursue a degree in aeronautical engineering, choosing the BK Hostel (run by the college clerk BK) for its perceived freedom compared to their college accommodation. Ranga humorously punishes Aju and Bibi for their inability to pass all the exams. Unable to handle staying in the house, the trio decides to switch off their phones and leaveforo a different hostel in Tumkur. After their initial victory against Kutty, their association with Ranga begins to consume their lives, affecting their studies. Realizing their mistake, they apologize to Ranga. Reddy accuses Ranga of stealing his brand and seeks their help to eliminate him. They manage to study there, meanwhile Ranga keeps frantically searching for the boys.

Rewrite the plot summary with the sentences correctly ordered. Begin the plot summary with <PLOT_SUMMARY>.\n\nThe sentences are:\n\nFrom the recovered material, Alin figures out that the next theft will be in Prague. She tells him that she doesn't know who it will be, but she knows there's a plan. Just as Faysal is about to shoot again, Ozan shows up. However, Ozan thinks it's just her attraction to him that's keeping her there. So now, he basically made her go in circles to fall in love with him again. Guney already knew that Alin worked for Interpol, and he left a trail for her to find him on purpose. Faysal has a private painting collection. After 3 years, he did a press conference to show up on the grid again, but by this time, Alin had already started to work for Interpol in Paris. The next day is the day of the robbery, and Guney leaves Alin with a car to use all day while he has some work. Yet again, they're unable to catch him, and they're back to Istanbul and square one. The thief seems to be breaking into museums and stealing the least valuable works of art, ignoring the other priceless artifacts in the same location. At the time, Guney had dismissed the idea and said it must have been a random break-in. Alin immediately knows who the thief is now. However, the reason Guney decided to start stealing is because when they were first together, Alin told him that the Mona Lisa went up in value only after it got stolen. But she only manages to see her eyes as Alin was wise enough to cover her face. Alin and Guney spend more time together, and he tells her that he doesn't want to spend time apart, but he has a business trip to Prague for two days. This is obviously not the answer he wants, so he chokes her to try and get her to spill, but Ozan shows up at that moment. Putting this together helps them figure out the next target for the thief. In the meantime, Ozan has the information to figure out who is working with Guney now, and they also find a warehouse where they work. On the flight, Vera finds something strange about Alin and tells the other guy on their team, Omer (Hakan Ummak), that she might have been the cop who tried to break into the warehouse. Alin decides the best thing to do is leave and take Ozan and the team with her. Or maybe they start an underground art gallery together with all the stolen pieces and never get found out. Guney and Alin were going steady when he suddenly disappeared, without explanation, and left her heart broken. This is when she gets the billionaire treatment, and he takes her on a private jet and gifts her fancy new clothes. This left Alin heartbroken because he never reached out to her or told her anything about what he used to do. It seems he got interested in art thanks to his grandfather, who was a wonderful painter but was never recognized for his work. Since Ozan is an ex-narcotics officer, he is, of course, thrilled to lock up Faysal. Faysal Varli is an old man and a sleaze who is a businessman, and Guney plans on buying his company. This gives Guney the idea to break into the highly protected collection. Alin promises not to turn Guney in and tells him she loves him. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth. When Alin approaches Guney, he asks her for a second chance, and she pretends to reluctantly give in. There's a voice and face recognition step, and there are about 75 cameras leading up to the collection, so it's almost an impossible task. This is after Guney has been tormenting Alin to tell him she still loves him all the way while running away from Faysal. This is a foolproof security system with too many layers, yet Guney has the confidence to break into it. Guney takes Alin to a private dress rehearsal for a romantic musical she's been wanting to watch, and it is enough for her to fall for Guney again. Alin and Guney almost go all the way in his hotel room, but Alin claims they're going too fast and leaves. Alin convinces him to take her along. He gives Alin and Guney a private viewing of this collection, and immediately, Alin realizes they're all stolen. Alin is there to tell Faysal that his collection is going to be stolen from him, but he doesn't believe her. Interpol chief refuses to arrest Guney, as he is a billionaire and can easily buy the paintings he wants. Alin (Esra Bilgic) and Ozan (Ushan Cakir) are Interpol officers who have been assigned to investigate a series of art thefts around the world. It's his voice that's recognized, but Guney has a solution for it all. Faysal stands across from Guney and Alin in front of a lake, a dead end. The next day, Faysal shows up in her bedroom, and finds out it was Guney who stole the painting thanks to her notes in her apartment with all the investigation on Guney. Guney did Ozan a favor by giving him information about Faysal (when Guney broke into Faysal's vault, he found information and documents that linked Faysal to the drugs trade); in return, Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's only a harmless art and heart stealing person. He also says that Alin has a history with Guney, and hence they need solid evidence against him. Alin is right, but the thief is able to grab the painting in broad daylight with no one knowing and leave Alin just enough of a trace, see his face, but not be able to catch him. He asks for the crime scene, but Faysal tells him to leave if he doesn't have a warrant. Guney explains that he ran away the first time as he was scared of commitment. Alin's partner shows up at the hotel, saying she can't be doing a mission that her chief denied, but she's determined to catch Guney. Vera freaks out, but just when they're about to enter the room, Faysal is asked to go back to the house. There are two options, one is that Alin stops working for Interpol so that she and Guney can go on a robbing spree since they won't really have anything else to do and they're both clearly so interested in art. Her ex-lover, Guney (Birkan Sokullu). The second he's gone, Ozan and she follow him. Additionally, there's a set of words, like a pass key, that keeps changing, that Faysal himself has to repeat for the vault to open. Apparently, he found it really hard to find her, and when he did, he couldn't just tell her he was a thief. Faysal shoots past Guney's ear, just missing him to threaten him. Vera and Alin get into a physical fight, leading Vera to believe Alin is a cop. Alin decides she's going to use her charm to catch Guney red-handed. On the other hand, Guney will stop stealing for the thrill of it and go back to being just a boring old billionaire. Just as Guney is trying to break in and everything is going to plan, Faysal decides to bring a woman down to the vault. Guney had disappeared for some time without a trace because he was caught in Mexico. Guney takes Alin to his grandfather's house. They quickly realize that the art thief is not grabbing the least valued paintings at the museums but specifically all paintings related to love.

The Dragon kills them, including Lord Bayford, but the distraction allows Elodie to escape the mountain. She takes one of the rescue party's horses and hides under a rock as the Dragon burns the surrounding area in an unsuccessful pursuit. With the Dragon at her mercy, she convinces the Dragon of the truth and heals both of them with the glowing worms. Alerted by the conflagration that Elodie's sacrifice has failed, Isabelle resorts to kidnapping Elodie's younger sister Floria as a replacement. Isabelle describes the pact between the first king and the Dragon, where he had to sacrifice his three daughters to ensure peace between his people and the dragon. Elodie creates a diversion to reach Floria. Elodie advises the new bride and her family to flee, and the Dragon burns the palace with all the Aurean royals and nobles inside. Days later, Elodie, Floria, and Lady Bayford sail home, loaded with supplies and accompanied by the Dragon. Refusing to believe Elodie, the Dragon states that the first king's assault was unprovoked, and then attacks her, but Elodie tricks her into burning herself. The first king of Aurea leads a futile attack on a dragon residing in his realm. Elodie reaches a chamber with the note 'Safe Here She Cannot Reach', the names of past victims, and a map carved into the wall. In Elodie's sleep, the worms heal the burn on her leg. Telling her sister to hide, she confronts the Dragon and tries to convince her that they were deceived by the Aureans: by joining their cut hands at the wedding, the blood of the brides and the Aurean royals mingled, making the Dragon think of the princesses as being of Aurean descent. Elodie's stepmother, Lady Bayford, becomes suspicious of the motives of Queen Isabelle, leading her to futilely implore Elodie to end the engagement. All the king's men are killed, leaving the king at the Dragon's mercy. Elodie follows the map to a dead end at a high vertical drop on the mountainside. After learning this from a desperate Lady Bayford, Elodie returns to the mountain to rescue Floria, who the dragon has left alive as bait. A rescue party led by Lord Bayford arrives. Following a ceremony where their palms are cut and held together, Henry carries Elodie across the narrow path over the Dragon's lair, then at Isabelle's behest throws her down the chasm. Centuries later, Elodie, the adolescent daughter of Lord Bayford, receives a proposal from Queen Isabelle of Aurea to marry her son, Prince Henry. Recovering from the fall, Elodie realizes that she is the actual sacrifice. She escapes the Dragon after it burns her leg, and discovers an illuminated cave filled with glowing silk worms, which she collects as a light source. Upon arriving in Aurea, Elodie and Henry are initially uninterested in each other, but begin to bond as they share a desire to travel. She discovers the remains of dead dragon hatchlings, explaining the reason for the royal sacrifices.

He insists that Epstein has been doing it for many years. Working long hours, she does not get to see him often, but she tries to bond with him over a crush he has on a girl and buying him takeout. Including Emily in the dialogue, she tells her she welcomes her innovations, but reminds her they must find a way to work together regardless of the tension. Both Amanda are criticised for meeting Sam for drinks by Jason and Sam by another journalist. So, she tries to contact the photographer. They hold off until Epstein is suddenly found dead in his cell, and rumours circulate about the men's friendship. Sam McAlister left the BBC in 2021 and now teaches negotiation at the London School of Economics. PR representative Jason Stein is consulted, but the prince insists he ended his friendship with Epstein after the mogul's original underage sex scandals had come to light. The televised interview broadcast on 16 November 2019 focuses on Andrew's relationship with convicted sex offender Epstein and allegations of Andrew's sexual assault of a minor, which Andrew denies on several occasions. After tea, Sam convinces her to leave the grounds for a drink. Called out by a co-worker for being vocally critical of lead presenter Emily Maitlis and for having sensationalist leanings, the programme editor, Esme, has a word with Sam. Having spoken to Sam recently, Amanda agrees to meet and negotiate terms for an interview. In the morning, Amanda calls Sam with the interview time. Arriving home, Sam finds her mother, who has been looking after her teenage son Lucas. Jason suggests Amanda should reach out to several 'friendly' reporters to conduct one-on-one interviews to improve Andrew's image. Her mother gives her a pep talk, reminding her that she was responsible for the story. She knows that she is also a single mother, formally worked in banking and has been working for Andrew for seven years. Prince Andrew's private secretary Amanda Thirsk believes the Epstein photo is a key reason the palace's event was not attended by the press. His lack of remorse and accountability on screen \u2013 along with now-infamous bizarre, erratic statements about visiting a PizzaExpress in Woking and an apparent inability to sweat \u2013 is widely viewed as the public catalyst for the downfall of Prince Andrew, and a major PR crisis for the Royal Family as a whole. Once Newsnight secures the 'scoop of the decade', Sam is seemingly left out of the loop, as Esme and Emily work with two male journalists and do not include her. Amid negotiations for the potential interview with Prince Andrew, Amanda asks what Emily is like, then what Sam knows about her. Upset by the altercation, Sam vents to her mother. Jae gets back to Sam, sharing photos of young girls going in and out of Epstein's Manhattan home. After informing Esme, Sam rushes to Amanda's home to convince Prince Andrew to give Newsnight a TV interview. Soon afterwards, the Duke chooses to step down from his royal duties. In 2010, New York City photographer Jae Donnelly stakes out a private Manhattan home for an exclusive shot. Jae calls to let her know that Epstein is about to be taken into custody by the FBI for child sex trafficking. He eventually photographs Prince Andrew walking with Jeffrey Epstein in Central Park after photographing a young girl leaving from the same building just prior. Nine years later, directly after major staffing cuts are announced, young BBC Newsnight guest producer Sam McAlister comes across the photo placed next to a Prince Andrew sponsored, young entrepreneurs event article."],"ground_truth":"In 2010, New York City photographer Jae Donnelly stakes out a private Manhattan home for an exclusive shot.

Ben's pregnant sister-in-law Mary goes into labor earlier than expected and he takes her to the hospital, along with the girls, who are seen on camera when in the car. Thirty years later, Cassandra, going by 'Cassie', works as a paramedic in New York City alongside her co-workers Ben Parker and O'Neil. Ben revives her, but she begins to experience visions. Initially, she dismisses them as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, but after failing to prevent O'Neil's death, Cassie realizes that she can see into the future. The group lures Ezekiel to a condemned firework factory and sets up traps to disorient him while Cassie calls for a medical evacuation helicopter to fly to their location. Cassie wakes up to discover that she is now blind and paraplegic due to her injuries. Ignoring Cassie's instructions, the girls go to a diner where Ezekiel finds them. Cassie is taken to the hospital just as Mary gives birth to her son. During a dangerous call, Cassie falls into the water and has a near-death experience. In 1973 in the jungles of Peru, a research team led by Ezekiel Sims and his pregnant colleague Constance Webb discovers an unidentified species of spider with rare healing properties. An indigenous tribe attempts to save Constance by having the spider bite her, but she dies shortly after giving birth to Cassandra. After briefly incapacitating Ezekiel by ramming him with the car, Cassie takes the girls back to Queens and they take refuge in Ben's house. Cassie assures the girls that she will mentor them in their future roles when the time comes. She steals a taxi and takes Julia, Anya, and Mattie out of the city to hide them in a nearby forest. Cassie is also drawn to the same girls and intervenes to stop Ezekiel from ambushing them at Grand Central Terminal. Ezekiel intercepts them again, but Cassie rescues the girls in an ambulance and distracts Ezekiel so Ben and Mary can escape. An ignited firework strikes Cassie in the face, blinding her. Ezekiel, who has limited precognition power and enhanced physical abilities, collects information on three teenage girls: Julia Cornwall, Anya Corazon, and Mattie Franklin. Ezekiel betrays the team and claims the spider for himself, shooting Constance in a struggle over the spider before leaving her for dead. She experiences a plane of higher consciousness where all living things are connected and where every possible future can be seen. The chief puts Cassie through a ritual that separates her soul from her body. She learns that Constance sought the spider not for fame or money, as she had originally thought, but to save her from having the same fatal hereditary disease that Constance suffered from.

Three childhood friends (Dean (Zac Efron), Wes (Jermaine Fowler), and JT (Andrew Santino)) prank one of their neighbors on Halloween Night (in 1999( by lighting a bag of dog feces on fire and leaving it on their doorstep. In anger, Dean tells him that he is Rod, not Ricky. At the hospital, the trio learn that Susan already gave birth to a boy named Whitaker. When Rod gives the trio the impression that he personally knows Carly's ex, Gary Polisner, they decide to drug Polisner with a Ketamine pill, but the Rabbi eats the pill instead. Dean feels bad about how Rod was treated and apologizes to him, and this is when Rod gives Dean his business card. The fire spreads to the neighbor's scarecrow. Summerhayes asks Dean his thoughts, and they agree to the merger. On their flight, the trio turn off their phones, post something as 'Ricky', and write in their Bible of Ricky Stanicky, detailing all of what 'Ricky Stanicky' has done. Erin is heartbroken and says that it is too late for his apologies now. After learning the truth about Ricky, Susan tells JT he has to camp in the backyard for six months as punishment. Dean and JT are angry as this is more than what they make. Shortly after, Dean learns that Susan went into labor six weeks early, forcing them to hurry back. But Ted is also impressed when Ricky displays his knowledge of Ted's upcoming merger with World River. Erin reveals to Dean that she decided to pursue the story about Rod becoming Ricky. While in Atlantic City, they meet Rock-Hard Rod (John Cena), an actor and impersonator who sings sex-based parodies of popular songs. Erin and Susan encourage Dean and JT to spend time with Ricky. Rod reveals that he legally changed his name to Richard Barbara Stanicky and tells Dean that he is thankful for being given a new life. At the party, Ricky tells the trio that Carly is now his fiance, and that they are all going to work on cleaning the environment on the weekend. As Summerhayes is about to fire Dean, the World River executives approach Summerhayes and enthusiastically approve of his choice to hire Ricky, ready to agree to a merger. Ricky riles Ted when he calls him an old school banker who works to make rich people richer. Ted promotes Ricky as he believes Ricky tells him the truth. Failing to put out the fire, Dean writes the name 'Ricky Stanicky' on one of their costume pieces, leading police to believe that Ricky Stanicky, an out-of-town kid, was responsible for the prank. Erin meets with Dean and tells him that she knows Ricky Stanicky is Rock-Hard Rod. Rod says that he cannot go back to Atlantic City as he will be killed for some things he did (including being in debt to some mafia types), which he doesn't remember as he was drunk. Erin states it will be difficult, but hearing Ricky's recording of Dean talking about his love and appreciation for Erin helps. Ricky gives his stamp of approval to the merger. Erin also drops by, revealing that she scored a reporting gig for a local news channel's 'Hero of the Week' segment, and is pursuing a story on Ricky and his alleged humanitarian efforts. The next day, there is a party between Summerhayes' company and World River, where they intend to watch the premiere of Ricky's 'Hero of the Week' segment. Dean gets a call from 'Ricky' (who is really Wes), claiming that his testicular cancer is back, and that he is alone in Albany, New York. The 'Hero of the Week' story begins playing, and Rod tells the reporter about how he met Dean, and how the Ricky Stanicky Bible made him realize that he needed to change his life.

The guys had a 'Bible' on Ricky which had notes on every lie they told to their families about stuff they did with Ricky and share the same with Rod to bring him up to speed. Ricky also tells Ted that he has an 'Air-Dicking' habit when he gives presentations. In reality, JT and Dean received tickets to see Marc Rebillet in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Wes also told Keith that he dated Ricky (who he said was a bi), just in case he needed an out with Keith. The next day, Summerhayes reveals that in preparation for their merger with World River, a major company from San Francisco, he has hired Ricky Stanicky for $250,000 per year to advise on the World River deal. Wes almost tells everyone the truth, but Dean pivots by saying that Ricky lied in order to celebrate being 5 years cancer-free with his best friends. Dean & JT plan to get Ricky fired to get him out of their lives. At the party, Summerhayes introduces Dean, who confesses to all the guests that Ricky Stanicky is fake, apologizing and promptly leaving the party.

After eating a laddu Vanraj gives her, Janhvi obeys his every command like a puppet. He orders Janhvi to laugh herself to death and reveals that even if he is killed, Janhvi will continue acting on his last order until her death. Kabir cuts Vanraj's tongue off; when the girls try to kill him, he plays an edited recording of Vanraj's voice, in which he declares their freedom. He mocks Vanraj, who can no longer speak, for wanting power and states that true power comes from parents, who can go to any extent to protect their children. Realising their children might actually die, Kabir and Jyoti give him permission to take Janhvi. He asks them to give her to him, as he needs their permission to do so. The family is unsettled by his presence and Kabir asks him to leave. Vanraj wakes up and becomes very disappointed at this and as a result he asks her to undress herself and change her clothes. He survives her attempt, though grievously wounded when Jhanvi throw him from the terrace. Jyoti drives Dhruv to the hospital while, unbeknownst to Vanraj, Kabir trails him to his lair, having fixed a tracker in his cellphone earlier. Kabir offers money in exchange for sparing them but Vanraj sets the money on fire, declaring that he has no use for materialistic things; he reveals himself to be a demon who aims to control the world, believing himself to be as good as God. He then tells Vanraj that they will meet again the next day and leaves while Vanraj continues to suffer. Thus, the girls are freed from his control. When her father tries to steal Vanraj's phone, Janhvi urinates in her shorts to stop him so she does not have to stab him. He then requests her to dance for him; he then goes to sleep, instructing Janhvi to stab anyone who approaches. When police respond to a call from Jyoti's hidden cellphone, the family acts normal to prevent Janhvi from causing an explosion in the house. It is revealed that Vanraj has kept 108 other girls similarly hypnotised. Janhvi, upon Vanraj's orders, prevents her father from kicking him out. This compels Kabir to let him go, but Vanraj instructs Janhvi to kill her brother. Kabir Rishi, a chartered accountant, and his wife Jyoti reside in Dehradun, Uttarakhand with their kids Janhvi and Dhruv. When they refuse, Vanraj cuts the phone lines and torments the family by dictating Janhvi to do strange and cruel things, such as hitting herself, eating dry tea leaves, and attacking her brother. Having had enough and seeing Jhanvi naked, Kabir and Jyoti attack Vanraj. Vanraj arrives at the farmhouse, claiming that his phone's battery has died. A year later, Kabir is seen going down into an isolated chamber, where he has, in fact, held Vanraj captive. With Janhvi as the last addition, he prepares to sacrifice them. Earlier, Kabir had taken the home's security camera recording of Vanraj speaking to Janhvi, then spliced his words together to make it seem like Vanraj is ordering the girls to go back to normal. He declares that this is hell now and he is Vanraj's devil. On a vacation to their farmhouse at a remote hill station, they meet an enigmatic man, Vanraj Kashyap. This will complete the ritual for him to acquire the power to control anyone at will, as he believes humans do not deserve free will.

Vanraj wakes up and becomes very disappointed at this and as a result he asks her to undress herself and change her clothes. Having had enough and seeing Jhanvi naked, Kabir and Jyoti attack Vanraj. He orders Janhvi to laugh herself to death and reveals that even if he is killed, Janhvi will continue acting on his last order until her death. This compels Kabir to let him go, but Vanraj instructs Janhvi to kill her brother. He survives her attempt, though grievously wounded when Jhanvi throw him from the terrace. Realising their children might actually die, Kabir and Jyoti give him permission to take Janhvi. Jyoti drives Dhruv to the hospital while, unbeknownst to Vanraj, Kabir trails him to his lair, having fixed a tracker in his cellphone earlier. It is revealed that Vanraj has kept 108 other girls similarly hypnotised. With Janhvi as the last addition, he prepares to sacrifice them. This will complete the ritual for him to acquire the power to control anyone at will, as he believes humans do not deserve free will. Kabir cuts Vanraj's tongue off; when the girls try to kill him, he plays an edited recording of Vanraj's voice, in which he declares their freedom. Earlier, Kabir had taken the home's security camera recording of Vanraj speaking to Janhvi, then spliced his words together to make it seem like Vanraj is ordering the girls to go back to normal. Thus, the girls are freed from his control. As Kabir and his family recuperate at the hospital, Vanraj's hostages are safely returned to their homes by the police who inform Kabir that Vanraj has gone missing. A year later, Kabir is seen going down into an isolated chamber, where he has, in fact, held Vanraj captive. He mocks Vanraj, who can no longer speak, for wanting power and states that true power comes from parents, who can go to any extent to protect their children. He declares that this is hell now and he is Vanraj's devil. He then tells Vanraj that they will meet again the next day and leaves while Vanraj continues to suffer."}

Stilgar tells Jessica that Sietch Tabr's Reverend Mother is dying and that Jessica must succeed her by drinking the Water of Life\u2014a poison fatal for males and untrained women. This angers Chani, but she is compelled by Jessica to mix her tears with the liquid, which awakens him. Due to the continuing spice raids, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen replaces his nephew, Rabban, as Arrakis's ruler with his more cunning yet psychotic younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha. Previously summoned by the Baron, the Great Houses arrive in orbit\u2014Paul threatens to destroy the spice fields with atomics if they intervene. Jessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists who believe most strongly in the prophecy. Paul adopts the Fremen names 'Usul' and 'Muad'Dib'. Paul remains in the north, fearful that his visions of an apocalyptic holy war will come to pass if he goes south as a messiah. Irulan agrees to Paul's request for marriage on the condition that her father lives. As Shaddam chastises the Harkonnens for their failures, the Fremen launch an offensive, using atomics and sandworms to overpower the Sardaukar. Shaddam surrenders, but the Great Houses reject Paul's ascendancy, so he orders the Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet. During another raid on a spice harvester, Paul reunites with Gurney Halleck, who leads Paul to the hidden atomic stockpile of House Atreides. Feyd-Rautha volunteers to be Shaddam's champion, but Paul kills him in a duel. Paul challenges Shaddam for the throne and, to Chani's dismay, demands to marry Irulan. Chani refuses to bow to Paul and departs alone on a sandworm. On Arrakis, Stilgar's Fremen troops, including Paul Atreides and his pregnant Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen patrol. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar ships, Jessica and Alia reflect on the beginning of Paul's holy war. When Jessica and Paul reach Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the 'Outer World' will bring prosperity to Arrakis. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib and sends a challenge to Shaddam, who arrives on Arrakis with Irulan and the Sardaukar. Paul and Chani fall in love as Paul immerses himself in Fremen culture: learning their language, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, riding a sandworm, and raiding Harkonnen spice operations. Meanwhile, Gurney leads an assault on Arrakeen where he intercepts and kills a fleeing Rabban. The liquid also prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her; they agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy. Upon arrival, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. Lady Margot Fenring, a Bene Gesserit, is sent to evaluate Feyd-Rautha as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and secure his genetic lineage. Paul executes the Baron and captures Shaddam and his entourage. Paul meets with the southern Fremen war council, galvanizing the crowd by demonstrating his ability to discern their deepest thoughts. Jessica transmutes and survives the poison, inheriting the memories of all the past Reverend Mothers. Following the destruction of House Atreides by House Harkonnen, Princess Irulan, the daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, secretly journals her distaste over how her father betrayed the Atreides. Feyd-Rautha unleashes a devastating attack on the northern Fremen, destroying Sietch Tabr, killing Shishakli, and forcing Paul and the survivors to journey south.

Jakub struggles with loneliness and misses his wife, Lenka, who has recently stopped talking with him after he left her and their unborn daughter behind to go on the mission. Jakub and Lenka talk again, coming to terms with their relationship. Exploring his memories, Hanu\u0161 learns more about Jakub: his father was an informant of the state party and was killed when Jakub was young. The creature, whom Jakub names Hanu\u0161, wishes to understand humans better and to help Jakub with his loneliness. Hanu\u0161 leaves to die in space, but Jakub goes after him. The Czech mission has arrived shortly before a competing South Korean mission. Hanu\u0161 returns after this, revealing that he's dying due to a parasitic infection that wiped out his entire species. Lenka sends him a message telling him that she wants to leave him, but Commissioner Tuma, Jakub's commanding officer, prevents it from reaching him, to prevent Jakub's mental state from worsening. After showing Jakub an implanted memory of the miscarriage, which Jakub was not present for, Hanu\u0161, disappointed with humanity, leaves the ship, leaving Jakub distressed. Hanu\u0161 passes away due to the infection. The two finally arrive at the Chopra cloud, which is revealed to be a leftover of the beginning of the universe and where every moment of time exists simultaneously. Jakub arranges with Peter, a technician and good friend of his, to deliver a message to Lenka, asking for forgiveness for his neglect. She appears to him in a forest scene as a rusalka. Days later, still without news from Lenka, Jakub finds a spider-like creature with telepathic abilities inside a compartment of the ship. Within the cloud, Jakub comes to the conclusion that he wishes only to be with his wife. Jakub is picked up by the South Korean space vessel. He met Lenka, but often neglected her, being more focused on his career as a cosmonaut, going as far as leaving her when she suffered a miscarriage."],"ground_truth":"Czech astronaut Jakub Proch\u00e1zka is six months into a space mission to investigate a mysterious cloud of dust and particles, called Chopra, lying beyond Jupiter.

At a party organized for the new team, Rahim and Roy Choudhary have a bitter exchange, where they humiliate each other. The match draws with a score of 1-1 and the Indian team fails to qualify. Rahim requests the federation to let him coach the team again and promises that if the team does not win a gold medal, he will not coach any team again in his life. At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, the Indian national football team faces a major defeat against Yugoslavia with a score of 10-1. K. Rahim's health deteriorates and he begins coughing up blood, but still motivates the team by delivering an inspiring speech. After the match, Rahim makes them understand the importance of formation and coordination. Rahim begins to coach the team again and prepares them for the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta. A player from the Australian team disrespects Neville D'Souza and makes him tie his shoes. The Minister agrees, given the condition that only a selected few players will be allowed to go for the competition. Rahim personally speaks with the Finance Minister Morarji Desai and requests to let the team participate, explaining its significance. An Indian diplomat publicly criticises the decision of not allowing Israel and Taiwan to play in the competition, which angers the people of Indonesia, leading to massive public protests against the Indian team. Subhankar, who is now President, initially refuses but has to give in to his request as the other members of the federation give their votes to let Rahim coach the team, given the even poor performance of the team since the time Rahim was removed as coach. Rahim requests for permission to form another team with new players. Rahim then scouts for players from all over India and forms a new team consisting of Tulsidas Balaram from Secunderabad, Peter Thangaraj from Hyderabad and P. However, the Finance Ministry refuses to let the Indian team participate in the competition, given insufficient funds. In their first match, the Indian team is pitted against South Korea and they face defeat, with the teammates blaming one another for their poor performance. Rahim also learns that he has developed lung cancer due to his excessive smoking and will not live long. Thangaraj, the team's goalkeeper is injured before their first match and is replaced by Pradyut Barman, which weakens the team. The members of the All India Football Federation blame the coach Syed Abdul Rahim for the team's underperformance. On the day of the final match, where the Indian team would play against South Korea, the team bus is attacked by protesters and the military is brought in to provide security for them. Neville goes on to score a hat-trick and the Indian team wins the match with a score of 7-1, leaving the Australian team in shock. Roy Choudhary, an influential journalist from Calcutta holds a grudge against Rahim, as he has formed the team with very less number of players from Calcutta. His wife, Saira, motivates him, telling him to not give up and pursue his dream of leading the Indian team to win a gold medal. The members of the federation are reluctant, especially Subhankar, but he receives support from President Anjan, who grants him permission. At the 1960 Summer Olympics the Indian team is pitted against France, which is considered the best team in the world. On seeing Rahim's determination, Roy Choudhary has a change of heart and starts supporting the Indian team. Thangaraj and Singh also rejoin the team for the match. In their next match against Thailand, Jarnail Singh, a player from the Indian team is gravely injured by an opponent. Rahim instructs the Indian team \u2018to make them pay for it\u2019 and they go on to play more aggressively, winning the match with a score of 4-1."],"ground_truth":"At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, the Indian national football team faces a major defeat against Yugoslavia with a score of 10-1.

The landlady shows Bea that the door opens into an old storage room. Benjamin meets his IF, a cartoonish dragon with glasses. She also meets the other creature, a butterfly-like being named Blossom, and faints. She rushes back to see Cal, now able to see him again, and wishes him a farewell. She tells him a story about realizing she was pushing herself to act like a grown-up when she's just a child who still needs her father. She awakens in Cal's apartment where she learns that he has been working with imaginary friends, nicknamed IFs, to place them with new children as their original children have grown up and forgotten them. When Bea says she does not want to say goodbye to her dad, Cal advises her to tell him a story instead. The next day, she sees the creature again, accompanied by a man. He wakes up and they reassure each other. She chafes against his playful antics, insisting she can handle the situation with maturity. Bea finds an old picture she painted of herself, her parents and a clown named Calvin. She, Cal, and Lewis audition the IFs, but he is unable to see any of them. He gives her an idea that maybe IFs do not need new kids, but rather to reunite with their old ones. After Bea and her father drive off, Margaret asks Blossom if the two of them should go inside, causing Blossom to realize Margaret can see her. One night, Bea goes out to buy a charger for her mother's old camcorder and sees an unfamiliar creature, following it back to her grandmother's building. There, he introduces Bea to Lewis, an elderly teddy bear who is the head of the facility. Bea goes upstairs to thank Cal, but no one answers his door. At the hospital, a nurse reassures Bea that her father will be all right. Bea tries to match one of the IFs with Benjamin, a young patient at the hospital. He inspires Bea to use her imagination to redesign the facility, much to the chagrin of Cal. Initially reluctant, Bea eventually decides to help Cal. After her dad is released from the hospital, he and Bea pack up to go home. The next day, Cal takes Bea to Memory Lane Retirement Home, a retirement community for IFs housed underneath a swing in Coney Island. Realizing Blossom was her grandmother's IF, Bea decides to test Lewis' idea. Bea follows them to a nearby house where the man, Cal, retrieves a large furry purple creature named Blue. Some time later, Cal begins reuniting the IFs with their original kids, now grown up. Feeling unmotivated, Bea talks with Lewis on the Coney Island pier. Bea and her father return home, where he trips over Keith, his invisible imaginary friend. 12-year-old Bea moves into her grandmother Margaret's apartment in New York while her father waits for heart surgery in the same hospital where her mother died of cancer years earlier.

Following a tip, Bea, Cal, and Blue find Blue's original kid, Jeremy, now a grown man trying to launch a business. By eating a fresh croissant in front of Jeremy, Bea reminds him of his childhood home above his parents' bakery; Jeremy remembers Blue enough for Blue to give Jeremy the confidence he needs for a business presentation.

As Noa hides from them, the apes follow his horse back to his clan. Noa confronts Mae, demanding the truth in exchange for his help. Mae discloses knowledge of a hidden entrance to the vault and says that a mysterious \u2018book\u2019 capable of restoring speech to humanity is inside. As Noa takes Soona to look through a telescope he found on his journey, Mae travels to a human settlement at a satellite base, which is kept quarantined from the outside world. The group enters the vault, which is a military bunker housing a stockpile of weapons and Mae's 'book', which is actually a deciphering key for a satellite. Many generations after Caesar's death, apes have established numerous clans, while most humans have become feral-esque. Noa leads his clan in summoning their eagles to attack Proximus and send him falling off a cliff into the sea. Left for dead, Noa awakens, discovering that his clan has been abducted. Proximus invites Noa to dinner along with Mae and Trevathan, a human prisoner who is teaching Proximus about the old human world. Trevathan catches them and intends to warn Proximus, but Mae kills him. When the trio encounters a group of feral humans, Sylva's raiders suddenly attack. However, a human scavenger follows Noa home and inadvertently cracks his egg during a scuffle before fleeing. Mae delivers the decipher key, allowing the humans to reactivate the satellites and successfully contact other humans worldwide. Lightning, one of Proximus's apes threatens to kill Soona, but Mae kills him with a gun she found. Mae flees the settlement while the apes climb to higher ground through the bunker. Proximus believes that Noa's intelligence could help open the vault and warns him that Mae only has her own agenda. Proximus has enslaved other clans, forcing them to work on opening the vault so he can access the human technology locked inside. She reveals that her name is Mae and that the raiders took Noa's clan to a beachfront settlement outside an old human vault. Noa is pursued by Sylva, but Noa traps and drowns him. Mae refuses and triggers the explosives, flooding the bunker with the apes inside. Noa and Raka rescue Nova who, to their surprise, can speak. He buries his father and sets out to rescue his clan. Noa then argues that if weapons and technology are only for humans, it suggests that nothing belongs to the apes, questioning whether apes and humans can coexist peacefully given Mae's fundamental disparity. Noa escapes the bunker with his clan, but Proximus attacks him. Noa reunites with his clan and is introduced to the apes' self-proclaimed king, Proximus Caesar. Noa agrees to help her enter the vault, hoping to destroy Proximus' settlement and lead his clan back home. Proximus tells Mae that she can leave if she tells him where the other weapons are. As they cross a bridge on their way to the settlement, they are ambushed by Sylva. Noa hurries home to find his village burning; the raider leader Sylva kills Noa's father before dropping Noa from a high platform. As Noa's clan returns to rebuild their home, Mae arrives to bid farewell to Noa, concealing a gun behind her back but never revealing or using it. While searching for a replacement egg, Noa encounters a group of ape raiders using electric weapons. The apes discover old picture books depicting humans as the once-dominant species and apes in cages at a zoo. Noa, Mae, Soona, and Anaya secretly plant explosives around the levee that surrounds the settlement. She explains that she destroyed the bunker and prevented the apes from accessing the weapons in the bunker because those weapons were created by humans and should only be used by humans.

Noa, a young chimpanzee from a falconry-practicing clan, prepares for a coming-of-age ceremony by collecting eagle eggs with his friends Anaya and Soona. However, a human scavenger follows Noa home and inadvertently cracks his egg during a scuffle before fleeing. While searching for a replacement egg, Noa encounters a group of ape raiders using electric weapons. As Noa hides from them, the apes follow his horse back to his clan. Noa hurries home to find his village burning; the raider leader Sylva kills Noa's father before dropping Noa from a high platform. Left for dead, Noa awakens, discovering that his clan has been abducted. He buries his father and sets out to rescue his clan. On his journey, he is joined by Raka, an orangutan who tells Noa about Caesar's teachings. The apes notice they are being followed by the human scavenger; Raka offers her food and a blanket, naming her Nova. When the trio encounters a group of feral humans, Sylva's raiders suddenly attack. Noa and Raka rescue Nova who, to their surprise, can speak. She reveals that her name is Mae and that the raiders took Noa's clan to a beachfront settlement outside an old human vault. As they cross a bridge on their way to the settlement, they are ambushed by Sylva. In the ensuing fight, Raka saves Mae from drowning but is swept away by the rapids. Noa and Mae are captured and taken to the apes' settlement. Noa reunites with his clan and is introduced to the apes' self-proclaimed king, Proximus Caesar. Proximus has enslaved other clans, forcing them to work on opening the vault so he can access the human technology locked inside. Proximus invites Noa to dinner along with Mae and Trevathan, a human prisoner who is teaching Proximus about the old human world. Proximus believes that Noa's intelligence could help open the vault and warns him that Mae only has her own agenda. Noa confronts Mae, demanding the truth in exchange for his help. Mae discloses knowledge of a hidden entrance to the vault and says that a mysterious \u2018book\u2019 capable of restoring speech to humanity is inside. Noa agrees to help her enter the vault, hoping to destroy Proximus' settlement and lead his clan back home. Noa, Mae, Soona, and Anaya secretly plant explosives around the levee that surrounds the settlement. Trevathan catches them and intends to warn Proximus, but Mae kills him. The group enters the vault, which is a military bunker housing a stockpile of weapons and Mae's 'book', which is actually a deciphering key for a satellite. The apes discover old picture books depicting humans as the once-dominant species and apes in cages at a zoo. As the group makes their way out of the bunker, they are confronted by Proximus and his tribe. Lightning, one of Proximus's apes threatens to kill Soona, but Mae kills him with a gun she found. Proximus tells Mae that she can leave if she tells him where the other weapons are. Mae refuses and triggers the explosives, flooding the bunker with the apes inside. Mae flees the settlement while the apes climb to higher ground through the bunker. Noa is pursued by Sylva, but Noa traps and drowns him. Noa escapes the bunker with his clan, but Proximus attacks him. Noa leads his clan in summoning their eagles to attack Proximus and send him falling off a cliff into the sea. As Noa's clan returns to rebuild their home, Mae arrives to bid farewell to Noa, concealing a gun behind her back but never revealing or using it. She explains that she destroyed the bunker and prevented the apes from accessing the weapons in the bunker because those weapons were created by humans and should only be used by humans. Noa then argues that if weapons and technology are only for humans, it suggests that nothing belongs to the apes, questioning whether apes and humans can coexist peacefully given Mae's fundamental disparity. As Noa takes Soona to look through a telescope he found on his journey, Mae travels to a human settlement at a satellite base, which is kept quarantined from the outside world. Mae delivers the decipher key, allowing the humans to reactivate the satellites and successfully contact other humans worldwide."}
